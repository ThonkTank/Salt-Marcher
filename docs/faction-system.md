# Faction System

**Phase 8.4 Complete** - Full integration with encounters, calendar, and map visualization

## Overview

The Faction System enables GMs to track organizations ranging from small wolf packs to kingdoms. Each faction has:
- **Members**: Named NPCs and unit types with quantities
- **Resources**: Gold, food, equipment, magic, influence
- **Relationships**: Structured faction-to-faction relations (-100 to +100)
- **Positions**: Hex coordinates, POI names, expeditions, or unassigned
- **Jobs**: Crafting, gathering, training, summoning, guard, patrol, research

### Event System Integration

**Files:**
- `src/features/events/hooks/faction-handler.ts` - Event hook for faction updates
- `src/features/events/hooks/location-handler.ts` - Event hook for location updates

**Hooks:**
- `faction:update` - Triggered when faction data changes
- `location:update` - Triggered when faction positions/camps change

These hooks are registered in the event engine and ready for integration with the simulation system.

## Phase 8.2: AI & Simulation (Complete)

**Files:**
- `src/features/factions/faction-ai.ts` - Decision-making AI engine
- `src/features/factions/faction-simulation.ts` - Background simulation engine
- `src/features/factions/npc-generator.ts` - Procedural NPC name/profile generation
- `src/features/factions/plot-hooks.ts` - Plot hook generation from faction events
- `src/features/factions/ai-types.ts` - Type definitions for AI system

### Decision-Making AI ‚úÖ
**Implementation:** `faction-ai.ts`
- **Goal Pursuit**: AI evaluates faction goals and generates prioritized decisions (13 decision types)
- **Resource Management**: Detects critical shortages (gold < 200, food < 100) and prioritizes gathering
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles threats, territorial disputes, and hostile relationships
- **Strategy Adaptation**: Weight-based priority system adjusts to goals, influence, and context
- **Decision Types**: expand_territory, gather_resources, recruit_units, establish_camp, send_expedition, train_members, research_magic, build_structure, form_alliance, declare_war, raid_target, defend_territory, trade_resources, rest_and_recover

### NPC Generation ‚úÖ
**Implementation:** `npc-generator.ts`
- **Procedural Names**: 6 culture templates (Elven, Human, Dwarven, Orcish, Goblinoid, Undead, Mixed) with prefixes/suffixes
- **Profile Generation**: Combines species appearance, cultural traits, faction values, and role descriptors
- **Role Assignment**: 8 role types (Leader, Scout, Guard, Worker, Mage, Priest, Warrior, Merchant) with role-specific descriptors
- **Personality Traits**: Generated from faction goals and culture tags (3 traits per NPC)
- **Background Stories**: Contextual backgrounds mentioning faction motto and role

### Camp/POI Creation (Planned for Phase 8.3)
- **Automatic Camps**: Factions establish bases on map hexes
- **Influence Zones**: Visual representation of faction control
- **Building System**: Track structures, production, defenses
- **Growth/Decline**: Camps expand or collapse based on resources

### Continuous Simulation ‚úÖ
**Implementation:** `faction-simulation.ts`
- **Resource Production**: Base production per day (gold: +10, food: +5, influence: +1)
- **Resource Consumption**: Member upkeep (food: 1/day, gold: 2/day per active member)
- **Job Processing**: Jobs progress 10% per day, complete at 100%
  - Crafting: Produces equipment (+50)
  - Gathering: Produces food/resources (+100)
  - Training: Increases unit quantities
  - Research: Produces magic resources (+20)
  - Summoning: Adds new creatures
  - Guard/Patrol: Provides stability
- **Unit Training**: Training jobs increase unit quantities
- **Expedition Movement**: Random events (5% chance/day): discoveries, encounters, resource finds
- **Event Generation**: Crisis detection (food < 50, gold < 100) generates warnings and events
- **Simulation Tick**: Process entire faction state in one game day

### Plot Hook Generation ‚úÖ
**Implementation:** `plot-hooks.ts`
- **Decision Hooks**: Generate plot hooks from all 14 AI decision types
- **Event Hooks**: Convert simulation events (crisis, discovery, conflict) into plot hooks
- **Relationship Hooks**: Generate hooks from faction relationships (-60: war, -20: tension, +60: alliance)
- **Resource Hooks**: Detect resource crises (gold < 200, food < 100) and generate opportunity hooks
- **Goal Hooks**: Extract hooks from faction goal tags (conquest, knowledge, trade)
- **Hook Categories**: conflict, alliance, discovery, crisis, opportunity, mystery
- **Urgency Levels**: 1-5 scale with objectives, rewards, complications

### Timeline Integration (Ready for Phase 8.3)
- **Event Scheduling**: Simulation events have dates and importance levels
- **Inbox Notifications**: Events marked with importance >= 4 are logged
- **Contextual Triggers**: Ready to hook into calendar advance, hex travel, encounters

## Architecture Patterns

### Position Tracking
All faction members have explicit positions:
- **Hex**: On the map at specific coordinates
- **POI**: At a named location (camp, city, dungeon)
- **Expedition**: Traveling along a route
- **Unassigned**: Not yet positioned (newly recruited)

This enables:
- Encounter context: "What faction members are on this hex?"
- Resource logistics: "How many units are defending this camp?"
- Expedition tracking: "Where is the scouting party?"

### Job System
Jobs represent ongoing activities:
- **Input**: Building, resources consumed
- **Process**: Progress tracking (0-100%, advances 10%/day)
- **Output**: Resources produced, units trained, etc.

Simulation engine:
- Ticks job progress over time
- Consumes/produces resources automatically
- Generates events on completion
- Clears job assignment after completion

### Member Quantity Management
Unit types track available quantities:
- **Recruitment**: Jobs can increase quantity
- **Losses**: Combat, events, or attrition decrease quantity
- **Balancing**: Simulation ensures "the last goblin warrior falls eventually"

Named NPCs don't have quantity - they're unique individuals.

## Testing

## Phase 8.3: Integration & Automation (Stub Implementation) ‚úÖ

**Files:**
- `src/features/factions/faction-integration.ts` - Integration helper functions
- `devkit/testing/unit/features/factions/faction-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests (15 tests)

### Integration Points ‚úÖ
**Implementation:** `faction-integration.ts`

Three integration helper functions provided architectural foundation:

1. **`getFactionMembersAtHex(app, hexCoord)`** - Encounter Integration
   - Returns faction members present at a hex coordinate
   - Used by encounter generator to add faction NPCs to encounters
   - Phase 8.3: Stub with TODO markers

2. **`getAllFactionCamps(app, poiLookup?)`** - Map Visualization
   - Returns location markers for faction camps/territories
   - Used by cartographer to display faction presence
   - Phase 8.3: Stub with TODO markers

3. **`runDailyFactionSimulation(app, calendarDate?, elapsedDays?)`** - Calendar Integration
   - Runs simulation for all factions when time advances
   - Returns important events for calendar inbox
   - Phase 8.3: Stub with TODO markers

## Phase 8.4: Full Faction Integration ‚úÖ

**Files:**
- `src/features/factions/faction-integration.ts` - Completed integration implementation
- `devkit/testing/unit/features/factions/faction-integration.test.ts` - Updated tests (15 tests)

### Full Implementation ‚úÖ

All TODO markers from Phase 8.3 have been implemented:

1. **Full YAML Parsing** ‚úÖ
   - Uses `js-yaml` library for complete frontmatter parsing
   - Deserializes members, resources, relationships, positions, jobs
   - Validates required fields and handles malformed data gracefully

2. **Coordinate System Conversion** ‚úÖ
   - Cube {q,r,s} ‚Üí Axial {q,r} ‚Üí Odd-R {r,c}
   - Validates cube constraint (q+r+s = 0)
   - Inline `axialToOddr` function to avoid circular dependencies

3. **POI‚ÜíCoordinate Lookup** ‚úÖ
   - Callback function pattern: `poiLookup?: (poiName: string) => Coord | null`
   - Integrates with location marker store
   - Gracefully handles missing POIs

4. **Calendar Integration** ‚úÖ
   - Accepts ISO date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and elapsed days
   - Passes to simulation tick for date-aware processing
   - Events include date field for timeline integration

5. **Persistence** ‚úÖ
   - Applies resource changes (additive deltas)
   - Removes/adds members based on simulation results
   - Clears completed jobs from member assignments
   - Serializes to YAML + Markdown using `factionToMarkdown`
   - Writes back to faction files atomically

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Encounter integration - get faction members at specific hex
const factionMembers = await getFactionMembersAtHex(app, { q: 5, r: -3, s: -2 });
for (const { faction, members } of factionMembers) {
  console.log(`${faction.name} has ${members.length} members at this hex`);
  // Use members in random encounter generation
}

// Map visualization - display all faction camps
const camps = await getAllFactionCamps(app, (poiName) => {
  const marker = locationMarkerStore.getByLocationName(poiName);
  return marker?.coord;
});
locationMarkerStore.setMarkers(camps);

// Calendar integration - run daily simulation with date
const result = await runDailyFactionSimulation(app, "1492-03-15", 1);
console.log(`Simulated ${result.factionsProcessed} factions`);
console.log(`Generated ${result.events.length} important events`);
// Add result.events to calendar inbox with dates
```

### Architecture Benefits

- **Decoupled**: Functions accept callbacks for external dependencies (POI lookup)
- **Flexible**: Calendar date and elapsed days are optional parameters
- **Safe**: Wrapped logger calls in try-catch for test compatibility
- **Complete**: Full YAML round-trip (parse ‚Üí modify ‚Üí serialize ‚Üí save)
