# Salt Marcher – Library Refactor Phase 1

This folder collects all artefacts from the phase-1 assessment of the Library feature. Each document is self-contained and cites the corresponding source files. The inventory covers the current architecture, data contracts, technical debt and risk surface so that phase 2 can focus on solution design.

## Contents
- `executive-summary.md` – key findings for refactor planning.
- `component-inventory.md` – catalogue of Library modules and dependencies.
- `dependency-graph.*` – dependency map (PNG plus machine-readable graph).
- `data-flow-overview.md` – IO and watcher flows.
- `domain-serialization.md` – domain models and persistence layouts.
- `renderer-contract-audit.md` – lifecycle conformance analysis.
- `presets-import-review.md` – preset/import workflow audit.
- `technical-debt-register.csv` – structured debt backlog.
- `complexity-coverage.md` – hotspots and test coverage snapshot.

- `ADR-0001-current-architecture.md` – baseline architecture decision record.
