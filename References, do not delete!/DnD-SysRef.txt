D20 Tests
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
game uses a d20 roll to determine success or fail-
ure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come
in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and
attack rolls. They follow these steps:
4: Roll 1d20. You always want to roll high. If the
roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described
later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s,
but you use the number rom only one othem—
the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower
one if you have Disadvantage.
5: Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the num-
ber rolled on the d20:
• The Relevant Ability Modifier. “Playing the
Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability
modifiers to use or various D20 Tests.
• Your Proficiency Bonus IRelevant. Each crea-
ture has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added
when making a D20 Test that uses something,
such as a skill, in which the creature has pro-
ficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the
Game.”
• Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class
feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus
or penalty to the die roll.
6: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the
total othe d20 and its modifiers equals or ex-
ceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines
target numbers and tells players whether their
rolls are successful. The target number for an
ability check or a saving throw is called a Difi-
culty Class (DC). The target number for an attack
roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears
on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules
Glossary”).
Ability Checks
An ability check represents a creature using talent
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertain-
ing a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the
rules often call for an ability check when a creature
attempts something other than an attack that has a
chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is
uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice de-
termine the result.
Ability Modiﬁer
An ability check is named or the ability modifier it
uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so
on. Different ability checks are called for in differ-
ent situations, depending on which ability is most
relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for
examples of each check’s use.
Ability Check Examples
Ability
Make a Check To …
Strength
Lift, push, pull, or break something
Dexterity
Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly
Constitution
Push your body beyond normal limits
Intelligence
Reason or remember
Wisdom
Notice things in the environment or in
creatures’ behavior
Charisma
Inﬂuence, entertain, or deceive
Proﬁciency Bonus
Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check
when the GM determines that a skill or tool pro-
ficiency is relevant to the check and you have
that proficiency. For example, ia rule reers to a
Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to the check iyou have
proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See
“Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” or more
inormation about skill and tool proficiencies.
Difﬁculty Class
The Dificulty Class oan ability check represents
the task’s dificulty. The more dificult the task,
the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain
checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typi-
cal Dificulty Classes table presents a range opos-
sible DCs for ability checks.

Saving Throws
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery
explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying
to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to
make a save; you must make one because your char-
acter or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A
save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.
If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can
choose to fail the save without rolling.
Ability Modiﬁer
Saving throws are named or the ability modifiers
they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom
saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are
used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on
the Saving Throw Examples table.
Saving Throw Examples
Ability
Make a Save To …
Strength
Physically resist direct force
Dexterity
Dodge out of harm’s way
Constitution
Endure a toxic hazard
Intelligence
Recognize an illusion as fake
Wisdom
Resist a mental assault
Charisma
Assert your identity
Proﬁciency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving
throw iyou have proficiency in that kind osave.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”
Difﬁculty Class
The Dificulty Class or a saving throw is deter-
mined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For
example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC
is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability
and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call
for saves specify the DC.
Attack Rolls
An attack roll determines whether an attack hits
a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usu-
ally occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in
“Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for
an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery
competition.
Ability Modiﬁer
The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability
modifier to use or dierent types oattack rolls.
Attack Roll Abilities
Ability
Attack Type
Strength
Melee attack with a weapon or an Un-
armed Strike (see “Rules Glossary”)
Dexterity
Ranged attack with a weapon
Varies
Spell attack (the ability used is determined
by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as
explained in “Spells”)
Some eatures let you use dierent ability modifiers
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property
(see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexter-
ity with a weapon that has that property.
Proﬁciency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll
when you attack using a weapon you have profi-
ciency with, as well as when you attack with a spell.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” or
more inormation about weapon proficiencies.
Armor Class
A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the
creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC
of a character is determined at character creation
(see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a
monster appears in its stat block.
Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same
base AC calculation:
Base AC = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modiﬁer
A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor,
magic items, spells, and more.
Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features
give characters a different way to calculate their AC.
A character with multiple features that give differ-
ent ways to calculate AC must choose which one to
use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a
creature.
Rolling 20 or 1
If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for
an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any mod-
ifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit
(see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”).
If you roll a on the d20 (a “natural ”) for an at-
tack roll, the attack misses regardless oany modifi-
ers or the target’s AC.
Advantage/Disadvantage
Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or
Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive cir-
cumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvan-
tage reflects negative circumstances.
You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage
through the use of special abilities and actions. The

that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For
example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM
might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the
character has Athletics proficiency, the character
adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check.
Ithe character lacks that proficiency, they make
the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.

The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes
example uses or each skill proficiency as well as
the ability check the skill most often applies to.
Determining Skills
A character’s starting skill proficiencies are deter-
mined at character creation, and a monster’s skill
proficiencies appear in its stat block.
Saving Throw Proficiencies
Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a partic-
ular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws, representing that class’s training in evading
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example,
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves;
they train to resist mental assault.
Equipment Proficiencies
A character gains proficiency with various weapons
and tools from their class and background. There
are two categories oequipment proficiency:
Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but profi-
ciency makes you better at wielding it. If you have
proficiency with a weapon, you add your Profi-
ciency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
Tools. Iyou have proficiency with a tool, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check
you make that uses the tool. Iyou have profi-
ciency in the skill that’s also used with that check,
you have Advantage on the check too. This means
you can benefit rom both skill proficiency and
tool proficiency on the same ability check.
Actions
When you do something other than moving or com-
municating, you typically take an action. The Action
table lists the game’s main actions, which are de-
fined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”

Player characters and monsters can also do things
not covered by these actions. Many class features
and other abilities provide additional action op-
tions, and you can improvise other actions. When
you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the
rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action
is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to
make, if any.
One Thing at a Time
The game uses actions to govern how much you can
do at one time. You can take only one action at a
time. This principle is most important in combat, as
explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a
social interaction, you can try to Influence a crea-
ture or use the Search action to read the creature’s
body language, but you can’t do both at the same
time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you
can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look
for traps and use the Help action to aid another
character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with
the Utilize action).
Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let
you take an additional action on your turn called
a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for
example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability,
a spell, or another feature of the game states that
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other-
wise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.
You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn,
so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you
have more than one available.
You choose when to take a Bonus Action during
your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is spec-
ified. Anything that deprives you oyour ability to
take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus
Action.
Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations al-
low you to take a special action called a Reaction. A
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone
else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in
“Playing the Game,” is the most common type of
Reaction.
When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction
interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immedi-
ately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s descrip-
tion says otherwise.
Social Interaction
During their adventures, player characters meet
many different people and face some monsters that
would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s
time for social interaction, which takes many forms.
For example, you might try to convince a burglar to
coness to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The
Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer
characters who are participating.
An NPC’s attitude toward your character is
Friendly, Indierent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules
Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help,
and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
Social interactions progress in two ways: through
roleplaying and ability checks.
Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how
your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is
part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
fore during social interactions.
As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an
active approach or a descriptive approach.
The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your char-
acter’s actions and attitudes to determine how an

System Reference Document 5.2.1
11
NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under
threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant
refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain
dragon laps up flattery.
When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to
the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s personality. You
might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then use
that inormation to influence the NPC.
If you offer NPCs something they want or play
on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form
friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece
of information. On the other hand, if you insult a
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your
efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.
Ability Checks
Ability checks can be key in determining the out-
come of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts
can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be
an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play
a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In
such situations, the GM will typically ask you to
take the Influence action.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when
thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use
an approach that relies on your group’s skill pro-
ficiencies. For example, ithe group needs to trick
a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue
who is proficient in Deception should lead the
discussion.
Exploration
Exploration involves delving into places that are
dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this sec-
tion detail some of the ways adventurers interact
with the environment in such places.
Adventuring Equipment
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help
them in many ways. For example, they can reach
out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things
they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or
another light source, bypass locked doors and con-
tainers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for
pursuers with Caltrops.
See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are
useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and
“Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful.
The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for
more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff,
for example, to push a sinister-looking button that
you’re reluctant to touch.
Vision and Light
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger,
hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are
affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can
hinder you, as explained below.
Obscured Areas
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a
Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim
Light, patchy og, or moderate oliage—you have
Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight.
A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with
Darkness, heavy og, or dense oliage—is opaque.
You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glos-
sary”) when trying to see something there.
Light
The presence or absence of light determines the cat-
egory oillumination in an area, as defined below.
Bright Light. Bright Light lets most creatures see
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources oillu-
mination within a specific radius.
Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, cre-
ates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light
is usually a boundary between Bright Light and
surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and
dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might
bathe the land in Dim Light.
Darkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured
area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night
(even most moonlit nights), within the confines o
an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.
Special Senses
Some creatures have special senses that help them
perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glos-
sary” defines the ollowing special senses:
Blindsight
Darkvision
Tremorsense
Truesight
Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to
spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an
ambush. The Game Master decides when circum-
stances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to
hide, you take the Hide action.
Interacting with Objects
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve.
The player tells the GM that their character is do-
ing something, such as moving a lever or opening

or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack
has the following structure:
1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your at-
tack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2: Determine Modifiers. The GM determines
whether the target has Cover (see the next sec-
tion) and whether you have Advantage or Dis-
advantage against the target. In addition, spells,
special abilities, and other effects can apply pen-
alties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3: Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as
detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit,
you roll damage unless the particular attack
has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks
cause special effects in addition to or instead of
damage.
Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can pro-
vide cover, making a target more dificult to harm.
As detailed in the Cover table, there are three de-
grees of cover, each of which gives a different bene-
fit to a target.
A target can benefit rom cover only when an at-
tack or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover
applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For ex-
ample, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half
Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters
Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.

Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow,
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.
Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets
within a specified range. Ia ranged attack, such as
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t
attack a target beyond this range.
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is
the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack
a target beyond long range.
Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more dificult when a oe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have
the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”).
Melee Attacks
A melee attack allows you to attack a target within
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand-
held weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.
Reach
A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack.
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
Opportunity Attacks
Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard.
If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put your-
self in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.
Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid
provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the
Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Oppor-
tunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are
moved without using your movement, action, Bonus
Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke
an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out
of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.
Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an
Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Re-
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack
occurs right before it leaves your reach.
Mounted Combat
A willing creature that is at least one size larger
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
Mounting and Dismounting
During your move, you can mount a creature that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs
an amount of movement equal to half your Speed
(round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet,
you spend 5 feet of movement to mount a horse.

Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a on the d20
for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If
you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain Hit Point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage
while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Sav-
ing Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.
Stabilizing a Character
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a
creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a suc-
cessful DC 0 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still
has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes
damage, it stops being Stable and starts making
Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that
isn’t healed regains Hit Point after d4 hours.
Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit
Points, as explained below.
Lose Temporary Hit Points First
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage,
those points are lost first, and any letover damage
carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you
have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage,
you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.
Duration
Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or
you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).
They Don’t Stack
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If
you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell
grants you 2 Temporary Hit Points when you al-
ready have 0, you can have 2 or 0, not 22.
They’re Not Hit Points or Healing
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit
Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving
Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Be-
cause Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a crea-
ture can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary
Hit Points.
If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit
Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only
true healing can save you.

Character
Creation
Choose a Character Sheet
You’ll record the main details of your character on
a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use
the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you
use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a
printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or
plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works
for you, and then embark on creating a character!
Create Your Character
Here are the steps to make a character; each step is
explored in detail:
1: Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member
of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s
vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2: Determine Origin. A character’s origin includes
two elements: background and species. How did
the character spend the years leading up to a life
of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors?
You can also choose your character’s languages.
3: Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your
character does in the game depends on the char-
acter’s six abilities.
4: Choose an Alignment. Alignment is a shorthand
for your character’s moral compass.
5: Fill in Details. Using the choices you’ve made, fill
in the remaining details on your character sheet.
Step 1: Choose Class
Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet.
The Class Overview table summarizes the classes.
See “Classes” for the classes’ details.

Write Your Level
Write your character’s level on your character
sheet. Typically, a character starts at level and
advances in level by adventuring and gaining Expe-
rience Points (XP).
Write Your XP. Also record your Experience
Points. A level character has 0 XP.
Starting at a Higher Level. Your GM might start
you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher,
write your chosen subclass on your character sheet.
See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in
“Character Creation” for more information.
Note Armor Training
Your class might give you training with certain
categories of armor. Note your armor training on
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of
armor means you can wear that armor effectively,
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of
armor are described in “Equipment.”
Step 2: Character Origin
Determining your character’s origin involves choos-
ing a background, a species, and two languages.
A character’s background represents the place
and occupation that were most formative for the
character. The combination of background, species,
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagi-
nation as you ponder your character’s earliest days.
Choose a Background
Choose your character’s background, and write it on
your character sheet. You can choose any of the back-
grounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM
might offer additional backgrounds as options.
The background you choose influences step 3,
when you determine your character’s ability scores.
If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores
and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds
benefit which ability scores. Look or your class’s
primary ability there.

Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat,
which grants your character particular capabilities.
Feats are detailed in “Feats.” Write the feat on your
character sheet.
Note Proficiencies. Your background gives profi-
ciency in two skills and with one tool. Record this
information on your character sheet.
Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your
class description in “Classes” and note the proficien-
cies on your character sheet.
The features table in your class description shows
your Proficiency Bonus (described in “Playing the
Game”), which is +2 for a level character. Note this
number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other
numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.
Choose Starting Equipment
Your background and class both provide starting
equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step
can be immediately spent on equipment from
“Equipment.”
Record your chosen equipment on your character
sheet. Equipment is described in “Equipment,” but
for now you can just write it all down and look up
the specifics in “Equipment” later. Note any coins
you have left after purchasing your equipment.
Choose a Species
Choose a species for your character. The following
species options are detailed in “Character Origins”:
Dragonborn, Dwar, El, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling,
Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you’ve chosen a spe-
cies, write it on your character sheet. Then record
your species’ traits.
Your character’s size and Speed are determined
by the character’s species; record these in the ap-
propriate places on your character sheet as well
(you may write just the first letter oyour size).
Imagine Your Past and Present
Let your character’s background and species inspire
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the
character’s present. With that in mind, consider an-
swers to the following questions as your character:
• Who raised you?
• Who was your dearest childhood friend?
• Did you grow up with a pet?
• Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
• Did you join an organization, such as a guild or re-
ligion? If so, are you still a member of it?
• What elements of your past inspire you to go on
adventures now?
Choose Languages
Your character knows at least three languages:
Common plus two languages you roll or choose
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a
language means your character can communicate in
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features
might also give you languages.
The Standard Languages table lists languages that
are widespread in the setting. Every player charac-
ter knows Common. The other standard languages
originated with the first members othe most
prominent species in the setting and have since
spread widely.

Step 3: Ability Scores
To determine your character’s ability scores, you
first generate a set osix numbers using the instruc-
tions below and then assign them to your six abili-
ties. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability
means.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
21
Generate Your Scores
Determine your ability scores by using one of the
following three methods. Your GM might prefer you
to use a particular one.
Standard Array. Use the following six scores for
your abilities: 5, 4, 3, 2, 0, 8.
Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record
the total othe highest three dice. Do this five more
times, so you have six numbers.
Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your
ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on
the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a
score of 4 costs 7 of your 27 points.

Assign Ability Scores
Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis-
dom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s
primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions
on where to assign scores for your character’s class.
The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main
abilities. If you used a different method to gener-
ate the scores, you may still use this table to guide
where you place your highest and lowest scores.

Adjust Ability Scores
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them ac-
cording to your background. Your background lists
three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and
a different one by , or increase all three by . None
of these increases can raise a score above 20.
Some players like to increase their class’s primary
ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.
Determine Ability Modiﬁers
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the
Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modi-
fier next to each oyour scores.

Step 4: Alignment
Choose your character’s alignment from the options
below, and note it on your character sheet.
The game assumes that player characters aren’t of
an evil alignment. Check with your GM before mak-
ing an evil character.
The Nine Alignments
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two actors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).
The summaries of the alignments below describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that align-
ment; individuals can vary from that behavior.
Lawful Good (LG). Lawful Good creatures en-
deavor to do the right thing as expected by society.
Someone who fights injustice and protects the inno-
cent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.
Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the
best they can, working within rules but not feeling
bound by them. A kindly person who helps others
according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.
Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as
their conscience directs with little regard for what
others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s
tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the
poor is probably Chaotic Good.
Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals
act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal
codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of
lie—and isn’t swayed either by the demands o
those in need or by the temptations oevil—is prob-
ably Lawful Neutral.
Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who
prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides,

Your spellcasting ability modifier or a spell is de-
termined by whatever feature gives you the ability
to cast the spell.
Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If
your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic
feature, your class features table shows the number
of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips
you know, and how many spells you can prepare.
Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note
them—along with your number ospell slots—on
your character sheet.
Level Advancement
While going on adventures, your character gains ex-
perience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A
character who reaches a specified Experience Point
total advances in capability. This advancement is
called gaining a level.
The Character Advancement table lists the XP
you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency
Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP
total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience
Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

Gaining a Level
When you gain a level, follow these steps:
1: Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the
same class. However, you might decide to gain a
level in another class using the rules in the “Mul-
ticlassing” section.
2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time
you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die.
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to
the roll, and add the total (minimum of ) to your
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points
by Class table.
Fixed Hit Points by Class
Class
Hit Points per Level
Barbarian
7 + Con. modiﬁer
Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger
6 + Con. modiﬁer
Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock
5 + Con. modiﬁer
Sorcerer or Wizard
4 + Con. modiﬁer
3: Record New Class Features. Look at your class
features table in “Classes,” and note the features
you gain at your new level in that class. Make any
choices offered by a new feature.
4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus. A character’s Pro-
ficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as
shown in the Character Advancement table and
your class features table in “Classes.” When your
Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the
numbers on your character sheet that include
your Proficiency Bonus.
5: Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat
that increases one or more of your ability scores,
your ability modifier also changes ithe new
score is an even number. When that happens, ad-
just all the numbers on your character sheet that
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum
increases by for each level you have attained.
For example, if a character reaches level 8 and
increases their Constitution score from 7 to 8,
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The
character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reach-
ing level 8.
Tiers of Play
With each new level, characters acquire new ca-
pabilities that equip them to handle greater chal-
lenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of
the game also changes, and the stakes of the cam-
paign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s
(and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play,


System Reference Document 5.2.1
25
since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians
and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.
Experience Points
The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on
your total character level, not your level in a partic-
ular class, as shown in the Character Advancement
table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you
are a level 6 Cleric / level Fighter, you must gain
enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your
second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a
Cleric.
Hit Points and Hit Point Dice
You gain the Hit Points from your new class as de-
scribed for levels after . You gain the level Hit
Points for a class only when your total character
level is .
Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice
are the same die type, you can pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have
a d0 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5
Paladin, you have ten d0 Hit Dice. If your classes
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep-
arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin,
or example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10
Hit Dice.
Proficiency Bonus
Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char-
acter level, not your level in a particular class, as
shown in the Character Advancement table. For
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue,
you have the Proficiency Bonus oa level 5 charac-
ter, which is +3.
Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than
your initial class, you gain only some of the new
class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each
class’s description in “Classes.”
Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its fea-
tures for that level. A few features have additional
rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the infor-
mation about multiclassing included in each of your
classes’ descriptions.
Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting,
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.
Armor Class
If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor
Class, you can benefit rom only one at a time.
For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s
Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Dra-
conic Resilience feature must choose only one of
those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.
Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than
one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make
more than two attacks with this feature unless you
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fight-
er’s Two Extra Attacks feature).
Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invo-
cation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature
with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.
Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes
and partly on your individual levels in those classes.
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more
than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one
class, follow the rules for that class.
Spells Prepared. You determine what spells you
can prepare for each class individually, as if you
were a single-classed member of that class. If you
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example,
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level or 2 (as
well as four Sorcerer cantrips).
Each spell you prepare is associated with one of
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of
that class when you cast the spell.
Cantrips. If a cantrip of yours increases in power
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total
character level, not your level in a particular class,
unless the spell says otherwise.
Spell Slots. You determine your available spell
slots by adding together the following:
• All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
and Wizard classes
• Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and
Ranger classes
Then look up this total level in the Level column of
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from
any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
This table might give you spell slots of a higher
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a
lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands,
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level,
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when de-
termining your spell slots, counting all your levels
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown

System Reference Document 5.2.1
26
in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four
level spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3
slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells,
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the
spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance
their effects.
Pact Magic. If you have the Pact Magic feature
from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature,
you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic
to cast spells you have prepared from classes with
the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast
Warlock spells you have prepared.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.
Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Blud-
geoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
Rage Damage. When you make an attack using
Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain
a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain
levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain
Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.
Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your
next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor
or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage
is still active on your next turn, you can extend
the Rage for another round by doing one of the
following:
• Make an attack roll against an enemy.
• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end
of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to
0 minutes.
Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Ar-
mor Class equals 0 plus your Dexterity and Consti-
tution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain
this benefit.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Mar-
tial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Great-
axes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long
Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one
of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain
the ability to use the mastery properties of more
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Level 2: Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge
perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving
throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
Level 2: Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to at-
tack with increased ferocity. When you make your
first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to at-
tack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on at-
tack rolls using Strength until the start of your next
turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage
during that time.
Level 3: Barbarian Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The
Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels.
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level
or lower.
Level 3: Primal Knowledge
You gain proficiency in another skill oyour choice
from the skill list available to Barbarians at level .
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can
channel primal power when you attempt certain
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using
one of the following skills, you can make it as a
Strength check even if it normally uses a differ-
ent ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,
Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your
Strength represents primal power coursing through
you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian lev-
els 8, 2, and 6.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 0 feet while you aren’t
wearing Heavy armor.
Level 7: Feral Instinct
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advan-
tage on Initiative rolls.
Level 7: Instinctive Pounce
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your
Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.
Level 9: Brutal Strike
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Ad-
vantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your
choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t
have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the
target takes an extra d0 damage of the same type
dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You
have the following effect options.
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 5 feet
straight away from you. You can then move up to
half your Speed straight toward the target without
provoking Opportunity Attacks.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
30
Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by
5 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can
be aected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—
the most recent one.
Level 11: Relentless Rage
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage
is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC
0 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to
twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this eature ater the first, the
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long
Rest, the DC resets to 0.
Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike
options.
Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on
the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next
turn.
Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next
turn, the next attack roll made by another creature
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.
Level 15: Persistent Rage
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all ex-
pended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts
for 0 minutes without you needing to do anything
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just
the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.
Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to
2d0. In addition, you can use two different Brutal
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike
feature.
Level 18: Indomitable Might
If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving
throw is less than your Strength score, you can use
that score in place of the total.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Irresistible Offense is recommended.
Level 20: Primal Champion
You embody primal power. Your Strength and Con-
stitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.
Barbarian Subclass:
Path of the Berserker
Channel Rage into Violent Fury
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker
direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their
path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in
the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize
and empower them.
Level 3: Frenzy
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active,
you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on
your turn with a Strength-based attack. To deter-
mine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal
to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.
The damage has the same type as the weapon or
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.
Level 6: Mindless Rage
You have Immunity to the Charmed and Fright-
ened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re
Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage,
the condition ends on you.
Level 10: Retaliation
When you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to
make one melee attack against that creature, using
a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Level 14: Intimidating Presence
As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others
with your menacing presence and primal power.
When you do so, each creature of your choice in a
30-foot Emanation originating from you must make
a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength
modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a ailed save,
a creature has the Frightened condition for min-
ute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use
of your Rage (no action required) to restore your
use of it.

one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can
have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
Once within the next hour when the creature fails
a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspira-
tion die and add the number rolled to the d20, po-
tentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic
Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.
Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspira-
tion die a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum oonce), and you regain all ex-
pended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die
changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as
shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Fea-
tures table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d0 at
level 0, and a d2 at level 5.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic
arts. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The
information below details how you use those rules
with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list
later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice
from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious
Mockery are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Bard spell list.
When you reach Bard levels 4 and 0, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level +
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level + spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 
spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color
Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list
matches the number on the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of levels and
2 in any combination.
If another Bard feature gives you spells that you
always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Bard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcast-
ing ability for your Bard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instru-
ment as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
Level 2: Expertise
You gain Expertise (see “Rules Glossary”) in two of
your skill proficiencies oyour choice. Perormance
and Persuasion are recommended iyou have profi-
ciency in them.
At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of
your skill proficiencies oyour choice.
Level 2: Jack of All Trades
You can add halyour Proficiency Bonus (round
down) to any ability check you make that uses a
skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise
use your Proficiency Bonus.
For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics)
check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add
halyour Proficiency Bonus to the check.
Level 3: Bard Subclass
You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College
of Lore subclass is detailed after this class’s descrip-
tion. A subclass is a specialization that grants you
features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your
career, you gain each of your subclass’s features
that are of your Bard level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8,
2, and 6.
Level 5: Font of Inspiration
You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic In-
spiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action
required) to regain one expended use of Bardic
Inspiration.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
33
Level 7: Countercharm
You can use musical notes or words of power to dis-
rupt mind-influencing eects. Iyou or a creature
within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an
effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened con-
dition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to
be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.
Level 10: Magical Secrets
You’ve learned secrets from various magical tradi-
tions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including
this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the
Bard Features table increases, you can choose any
of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric,
Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells
count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for
its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a
spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with
a spell from those lists.
Level 18: Superior Inspiration
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses
of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have
fewer than that.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Spell Recall is recommended.
Level 20: Words of Creation
You have mastered two of the Words of Creation:
the words of life and death. You therefore always
have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill
spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can
target a second creature with it if that creature is
within 10 eet othe first target.
Bard Spell List
This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Spe-
cial column, C means the spell requires Concentra-
tion, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a
specific Material component.

Bard Subclass:
College of Lore
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge
Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and se-
crets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes,
mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s mem-
bers gather in libraries and universities to share
their lore with one another. They also meet at festi-
vals or affairs of state, where they can expose cor-
ruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures oauthority.
Level 3: Bonus Proﬁciencies
You gain proficiency with three skills oyour choice.
Level 3: Cutting Words
You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract,
conuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and com-
petence of others. When a creature that you can see
within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or
succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can
take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic
Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and
subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll,
reducing the damage or potentially turning the suc-
cess into a failure.
Level 6: Magical Discoveries
You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can
come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or
any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its
spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a
spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the
Bard Features table.
You always have the chosen spells prepared, and
whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one
of the spells with another spell that meets these
requirements.
Level 14: Peerless Skill
When you make an ability check or attack roll and
fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;
roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number
rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into
a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t
expended.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
37
When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 0, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level +
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level + spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To start, choose four level spells
from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding
Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 
and 2 in any combination.
If another Cleric feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Cleric spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list opre-
pared spells, replacing any of the spells there with
other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Cleric spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as
a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.
Level 1: Divine Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following
sacred roles of your choice.
Protector. Trained or battle, you gain proficiency
with Martial weapons and training with Heavy
armor.
Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from
the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical con-
nection to the divine gives you a bonus to your
Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus
equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum o+1).
Level 2: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the
Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with
two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead,
each of which is described below. Each time you use
this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel
Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain ad-
ditional effect options at higher Cleric levels.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.
You regain one oits expended uses when you finish
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses
when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in
the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features
table.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this
class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your
Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within
30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it.
Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either
restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total
or force the creature to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic
or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that to-
tal. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
much damage (round down).
You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric
levels 7 (2d8), 3 (3d8), and 8 (4d8).
Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your
Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each
Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated
conditions for minute. For that duration, it tries
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any dam-
age, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if
you die.
Level 3: Cleric Subclass
You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life
Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Cleric level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8,
2, and 6.
Level 5: Sear Undead
Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a
number od8s equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of d8) and add the rolls together. Each
Undead that fails its saving throw against that use
of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the
roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
38
Level 7: Blessed Strikes
Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of
the following options of your choice (if you get ei-
ther option from a Cleric subclass in an older book,
use only the option you choose for this feature).
Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra
d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier
to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.
Level 10: Divine Intervention
You can call on your deity or pantheon to inter-
vene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any
Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a
Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast
that spell without expending a spell slot or needing
Material components. You can’t use this feature
again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes
The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows
more powerful.
Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine
Strike increases to 2d8.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric can-
trip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can
give vitality to yourself or another creature within
60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary
Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention
You can call on even more powerful divine interven-
tion. When you use your Divine Intervention fea-
ture, you can choose Wish when you select a spell.
If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again
until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.
Cleric Spell List
This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Spe-
cial column, C means the spell requires Concentra-
tion, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a
specific Material component.

Cleric Subclass: Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using
that life force to cure many hurts.
Existence itself relies on the positive energy as-
sociated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is
particularly associated with agricultural deities,
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and
community. Religious orders of healing also seek
the magic of this domain.
Level 3: Disciple of Life
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit
Points to a creature, that creature regains addi-
tional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s
level.
Level 3: Life Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the Lie Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.

Level 3: Preserve Life
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose
Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which
can include you), and divide those Hit Points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no
more than half its Hit Point maximum.
Level 6: Blessed Healer
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more crea-
tures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points
equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.
Level 17: Supreme Healing
When you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Chan-
nel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; in-
stead use the highest number possible for each die.
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a
creature with a spell, you restore 2.

how you use those rules with Druid spells, which
appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s
description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice
from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce
Flame are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Druid spell list.
When you reach Druid levels 4 and 0, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level +
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level + spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 
spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship,
Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 
and 2 in any combination.
If another Druid feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Druid spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list opre-
pared spells, replacing any of the spells with other
Druid spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Druid spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.
Level 1: Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids.
While learning this ancient tongue, you also un-
locked the magic of communicating with animals;
you always have the Speak with Animals spell
prepared.
You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You
and others who know Druidic automatically spot
such a message. Others spot the message’s presence
with a successful DC 5 Intelligence (Investigation)
check but can’t decipher it without magic.
Level 1: Primal Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following
sacred roles of your choice.
Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the
Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connec-
tion to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence
(Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your
Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus o+1).
Warden. Trained or battle, you gain proficiency
with Martial weapons and training with Medium
armor.
Level 2: Wild Shape
The power of nature allows you to assume the form
of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into
a Beast form that you have learned for this feature
(see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form
for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level
or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapac-
itated condition, or die. You can also leave the form
early as a Bonus Action.
Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice.
You regain one expended use when you finish a
Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain
Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of
the Druid Features table.
Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this
feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that
have a maximum Challenge Rating of /4 and that
lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for
stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider,
and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a
Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms
with another eligible form.
When you reach certain Druid levels, your number
of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating
for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast
Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can
adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
When choosing known forms, you may look in
other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master
permits you to do so.

Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you
retain your personality, memories, and ability to
speak, and the following rules apply:
Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild
Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to your Druid level.
Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced
by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your crea-
ture type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features;
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill
and saving throw proficiencies and use your Pro-
ficiency Bonus or them, in addition to gaining the
proficiencies othe creature. Ia skill or saving
throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher
than yours, use the one in the stat block.
No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape-
shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or oth-
erwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
Objects. Your ability to handle objects is deter-
mined by the form’s limbs rather than your own.
In addition, you choose whether your equipment
falls in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as nor-
mal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for
the new form to wear a piece of equipment based
on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
the form. Equipment that merges with the form
has no effect while you’re in that form.
Level 2: Wild Companion
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an
animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can
expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the
Find Familiar spell without Material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is
Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Druid Subclass
You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle
of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Druid level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8,
2, and 6.
Level 5: Wild Resurgence
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of
Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by ex-
pending a spell slot (no action required).
In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape
(no action required) to give yourself a level spell
slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long
Rest.
Level 7: Elemental Fury
The might othe elements flows through you. You
gain one of the following options of your choice.
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier
to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.
Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you
can cause the target to take an extra d8 Cold, Fire,
Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you
hit).
Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury
The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows
more powerful, as detailed below.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid can-
trip with a range of 0 feet or greater, the spell’s
range increases by 300 feet.
Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal
Strike increases to 2d8.
Level 18: Beast Spells
While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast

ponent with a cost specified or that consumes its
Material component.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Di-
mensional Travel is recommended.
Level 20: Archdruid
The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you,
granting you the ollowing benefits.
Evergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initia-
tive and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain
one expended use of it.
Nature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild
Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose
a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape
and convert them into a single spell slot, with each
use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you
convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level
4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do
so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Longevity. The primal magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years
that pass, your body ages only one year.

Druid Subclass:
Circle of the Land
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World
The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These
Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or stand-
ing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The
circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests
of their communities.
Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type
of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult
the table below that corresponds to the chosen
type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level
and lower prepared.

Level 3: Land’s Aid
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself.
Vitality-giving flowers and lie-draining thorns
appear for a moment in a 0-foot-radius Sphere cen-
tered on that point. Each creature of your choice in
the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one. One creature of your choice in that
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
The damage and healing increase by d6 when
you reach Druid levels 0 (3d6) and 4 (4d6).
Level 6: Natural Recovery
You can cast one of the level + spells that you have
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long
Rest before you do so again.
In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level
2 and a level spell slot, or three level spell slots.
Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Nature’s Ward
You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you
have Resistance to a damage type associated with
your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature,
as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear
in a 5-foot Cube on the ground within 20 feet of
yourself. They last there for minute or until you
have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and
your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and
your allies gain the current Resistance of your Na-
ture’s Ward while there.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to
60 feet to ground within 20 feet of yourself.

mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Mar-

once on a turn.

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battle-
field. When you ail an ability check, you can expend
a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward

potentially turning it into a success. If the check still
fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.
Level 3: Fighter Subclass
You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The
Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s de-

tures that are of your Fighter level or lower.

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a
bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the
new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until
you finish a Long Rest.
You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest
starting at level 3 and three times before a Long
Rest starting at level 7.
Level 9: Tactical Master
When you attack with a weapon whose mastery
property you can use, you can replace that property
with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.
Level 11: Two Extra Attacks
You can attack three times instead of once when-
ever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 13: Studied Attacks
You study your opponents and learn from each at-
tack you make. If you make an attack roll against a
creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next
attack roll against that creature before the end of
your next turn.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Combat Prowess is recommended.

If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5
feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a
creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that

turn, and the next attack roll made against the tar-
get before then has Advantage.
Level 6: Empowered Strikes
Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed
Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its
normal damage type.
Level 7: Evasion

to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed
on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.
You don’t benefit rom this eature iyou have the
Incapacitated condition.

place or object that has been consecrated or dese-
crated, as with the Hallow spell.

Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion
Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ar-
chetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and
some—or better or worse—hold the rest othe
world to the same standards.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods
of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings
into their helmets or coats of arms.
These paladins share the following tenets:
•
Let your word be your promise.
•
Protect the weak and never fear to act.
•
Let your honorable deeds be an example.
Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level
specified in the Oath oDevotion Spells table, you
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

When you take the Attack action, you can expend
one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one
Melee weapon that you are holding with positive
energy. For 0 minutes or until you use this feature
again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack
rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus
of +), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to
deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.
The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot
radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
You can end this effect early (no action required).
This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the
weapon.
Level 7: Aura of Devotion
You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed
condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a
Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no
effect on that ally while there.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 15: Smite of Protection
Your magical smite now radiates protective energy.
Whenever you cast Divine Smite, you and your allies
have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection.
The aura has this benefit until the start oyour next
turn.
Level 20: Holy Nimbus
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Pro-
tection with holy power, granting the benefits be-
low for 0 minutes or until you end them (no action
required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also re-
store your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot
(no action required).

throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an
Undead.

• Gain the Ranger’s level features, which are
listed in the Ranger Features table.
As a Multiclass Character
• Gain the following traits from the Core Ranger
Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Mar-
tial weapons, proficiency in one skill oyour
choice from the Ranger’s skill list, and training

listed in the Ranger Features table. See the mul-
ticlassing rules in “Character Creation” to deter-

when you reach the specified Ranger levels. These
features are listed in the Ranger Features table.
Level 1: Spellcasting

spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in
the Ranger spell list later in the class’s description.
Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level +
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
58
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level + spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 
Ranger spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Ranger spells
until the number of spells on your list matches the
number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your
list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells
of level or 2 in any combination.
If another Ranger feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Ranger spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Ranger spell for which you have
spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Ranger spells.

out a spell slot increases when you reach certain
Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy col-
umn of the Ranger Features table.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels
8, 0, 2, and 6.
Level 5: Cunning Strike
You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak
Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you
can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects.
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the
effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage
is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect,
remove d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before
rolling.
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw,
the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and
Proficiency Bonus.
Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike,
forcing the target to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned
condition for minute. At the end of each of its
turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit
on your person.
Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller,
it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have
the Prone condition.
Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the
attack, you move up to half your Speed without pro-
voking Opportunity Attacks.
Level 5: Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the at-
tack’s damage against you (round down).
Level 7: Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dan-
gers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows
you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage
if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the
Incapacitated condition.
Level 7: Reliable Talent
Whenever you make an ability check that uses one
oyour skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a
d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 0.
Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike
You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when
you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost
for each effect.
Level 14: Devious Strikes
You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack
deviously. The following effects are now among
your Cunning Strike options.
Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can
do only one of the following: move or take an action
or a Bonus Action.
Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Uncon-
scious condition for minute or until it takes any
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded con-
dition until the end of its next turn.
Level 15: Slippery Mind
Your cunning mind is exceptionally dificult to con-
trol. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma
saving throws.
Level 18: Elusive
You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the
upper hand against you. No attack roll can have
Advantage against you unless you have the Incapac-
itated condition.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the
Night Spirit is recommended.
Level 20: Stroke of Luck
You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when
you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the
roll into a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

liably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you
must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check
(DC 0 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check,
you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check,
the scroll disintegrates.

Sorcerer spells of level or 2 in any combination.
If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with

Sorcerer spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on
your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you
have spell slots.

ing ability for your Sorcerer spells.

Sorcerer Subclass: Draconic
Sorcery
Breathe the Magic of Dragons
Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon.
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor.
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused
with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a
treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a
dragon for an ancestor.
Level 3: Draconic Resilience
The magic in your body manifests physical traits
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum in-
creases by 3, and it increases by whenever you
gain another Sorcerer level.
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like
scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base
Armor Class equals 0 plus your Dexterity and Cha-
risma modifiers.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 3: Draconic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the
Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.

Alter Self, Chromatic Orb, Command,

Level 6: Elemental Afﬁnity
Your draconic magic has an afinity with a damage
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
You have Resistance to that damage type, and
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one
damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Dragon Wings
As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to
appear on your back. The wings last for hour or
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sor-
cery Points (no action required) to restore your use
of it.
Level 18: Dragon Companion
You can cast Summon Dragon without a Material
component. You can also cast it once without a spell
slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can
modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If
you do so, the spell’s duration becomes minute for
that casting.

Becoming a Warlock …
As a Level 1 Character
• Gain all the traits in the Core Warlock Traits table.
• Gain the Warlock’s level features, which are
listed in the Warlock Features table.
As a Multiclass Character
• Gain the following traits from the Core Warlock
Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light
armor.
• Gain the Warlock’s level features, which are
listed in the Warlock Features table. See the mul-
ticlassing rules in “Character Creation” to deter-
mine your available spell slots.
Warlock Class Features
As a Warlock, you gain the following class features
when you reach the specified Warlock levels. These
features are listed in the Warlock Features table.
Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of
forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abid-
ing magical ability or other lessons. You gain one in-
vocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. In-
vocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation
Options” section later in this class’s description.
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequi-
site, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For
example, if an invocation requires you to be a level
5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you
reach Warlock level 5.
Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever
you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of
your invocations with another one for which you

System Reference Document 5.2.1
71
qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a pre-
requisite for another invocation that you have.
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain
more invocations of your choice, as shown in the In-
vocations column of the Warlock Features table.
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once
unless its description says otherwise.
Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact
with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers.
The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability
to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spell-
casting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the
Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your
choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are rec-
ommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature
with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 0, you
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Fea-
tures table.
Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock
spells of levels –5. The table also shows the level
of those slots, all of which are the same level. You
regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you
finish a Short or Long Rest.
For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you
have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level spell
Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots,
and you cast it as a level 3 spell.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level + spells that are available for you
to cast with this feature. To start, choose two
level Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional War-
lock spells until the number of spells on your list
matches the number in the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in
the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When
you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new War-
lock spell, which can be of levels –3.
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count

against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Warlock spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on
your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible
level.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting
ability for your Warlock spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.
Level 2: Magical Cunning
You can perform an esoteric rite for minute. At
the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell
slots but no more than a number equal to half your
maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The
Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s
description. A subclass is a specialization that
grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For
the rest of your career, you gain each of your sub-
class’s features that are of your Warlock level or
lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels
8, 2, and 6.
Level 9: Contact Patron
In the past, you usually contacted your patron
through intermediaries. Now you can communicate
directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane
spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the
spell without expending a spell slot to contact your
patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s
saving throw.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t
do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an
arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this
arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without ex-
pending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest
before you can cast it in this way again.
As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain
another Warlock spell of your choice that can be
cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels
3 (level 7 spell), 5 (level 8 spell), and 7 (level 9
spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can re-
place one of your arcanum spells with another War-
lock spell of the same level.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Eldritch Master
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you
regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

Pact of the Blade
As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon
in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon o
your choice with which you bond—or create a bond
with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with
a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or
another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond
ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and
you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.
Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon,
you can use your Charisma modifier or the attack
and damage rolls instead of using Strength or
Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal
Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal
damage type.

feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more
than 5 feet away from you for minute or more, or

You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a
Magic action without expending a spell slot.

normal forms for your familiar or one of the follow-
ing special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit,
Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite, or Venomous

Additionally, when you take the Attack action,
you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow
your familiar to make one attack of its own with its
Reaction.
Pact of the Tome
Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure
forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or
Long Rest. This Book of Shadows (you determine its
appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you
can access, granting you the benefits below. The
book disappears if you conjure another book with
this feature or if you die.
Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears,
choose three cantrips, and choose two level spells
that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any
class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t
already have prepared. While the book is on your
person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and
they function as Warlock spells for you.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use the book as a
Spellcasting Focus.
Repelling Blast
Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip
That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll
Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that
requires an attack roll. When you hit a Large or
smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the
creature up to 0 feet straight away from you.
Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more
than once. Each time you do so, choose a different
eligible cantrip.
Thirsting Blade

weapon only. With that feature, you can attack
twice with the weapon instead of once when you
take the Attack action on your turn.

Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon
lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially
mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption
or destruction of all things, ultimately including
you—and your path is defined by the extent to
which you strive against those aims.
Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing
When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma mod-
ifier plus your Warlock level (minimum o1 Tempo-
rary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit isomeone
else reduces an enemy within 0 feet of you to 0 Hit
Points.
Level 3: Fiend Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock
level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you therea-
ter always have the listed spells prepared.
Fiend Spells
Warlock Level
Spells
3
Burning Hands, Command,
Scorching Ray, Suggestion
5
Fireball, Stinking Cloud
7
Fire Shield, Wall of Fire
9
Geas, Insect Plague
Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck
You can call on your fiendish patron to alter ate
in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add d0
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but
before any of the roll’s effects occur.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum oonce), but
you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Fiendish Resilience
Choose one damage type, other than Force, when-
ever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resis-
tance to that damage type until you choose a differ-
ent one with this feature.
Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the
target through the Lower Planes. The target must
succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your
spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles
through a nightmare landscape. The target takes
8d0 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the
Incapacitated condition until the end of your next
turn, when it returns to the space it previously oc-
cupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a
Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore
your use of it.

Wizard Subclass: Evoker
Create Explosive Elemental Effects
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful
elemental eects such as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from
afar. Others use their power to protect others, while
some seek their own gain.
Level 3: Evocation Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2,
and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wiz-
ard spell from the Evocation school to your spell-
book for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for
which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Potent Cantrip
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a can-
trip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the
cantrip.
Level 6: Sculpt Spells
You can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evoca-
tion spell that affects other creatures that you can
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 
plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automat-
ically succeed on their saving throws against the
spell, and they take no damage if they would nor-
mally take half damage on a successful save.
Level 10: Empowered Evocation
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evoca-
tion school, you can add your Intelligence modifier
to one damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Overchannel
You can increase the power of your spells. When
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels –5
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
The first time you do so, you suer no adverse e-
ect. Iyou use this eature again beore you finish a
Long Rest, you take 2d2 Necrotic damage for each
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it.
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
Each time you use this eature again beore finish-
ing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level
increases by d2.

Character Origins
Character Backgrounds
Your character’s background is a collection of char-
acteristics that represent the place and occupation
that were most formative before your character em-
barked on a life of adventure.
Parts of a Background
A background includes the following parts.
Ability Scores
A background lists three of your character’s ability
scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by , or
increase all three by . None of these increases can
raise a score above 20.
Feat
A background gives your character a specified Ori-
gin feat (described in “Feats”).
Skill Proﬁciencies
A background gives your character proficiency in
two specified skills.
Tool Proﬁciency
Each background gives a character proficiency with
one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen rom
the Artisan’s Tools category. Tools are detailed in
“Equipment.”
Equipment
Each background offers a choice between a package
of equipment and 50 GP.

Character Species
When you choose your character’s species, you
determine whether your character is a human or a
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn
or gnome.
The peoples of the multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms.
A player character’s species is the set of game traits
that an adventurer gains from being one of those
life forms.
Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence, or god, while other spe-
cies first appeared in multiple realms at once.
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have
spread across the multiverse and contribute to
many different cultures.
Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the spe-
cies in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span,
members of all species reach physical maturity at
about the same age. Your character can be any age
that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.
Parts of a Species
A species includes the following parts.
Creature Type
A character’s species determines the character’s
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glos-
sary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Hu-
manoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in
other books.
Size
Your character’s species determines the character’s
size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range
of heights, and some species include such diversity

System Reference Document 5.2.1
84
of size that you can choose whether your character
is Small or Medium.
Speed
Your character’s species determines the character’s
Speed.
Special Traits
Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physi-
ology or magical nature. When you choose a species,
your character gets all the special traits listed for it.
Some traits involve making a choice from a handful
of options.
Species Descriptions
Dragonborn

The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well
as the following details:
Category. Every type of armor falls into a category:
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as

Armor Class (AC). The table’s Armor Class column
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather

Strength column for an armor type, that armor
reduces the wearer’s speed by 0 feet unless the
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher
than the listed score.
Stealth. If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Armor Training
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only
those with training can use them effectively, as
explained below. A character’s class and other fea-
tures determine the character’s armor training.
A monster has training with any armor in its stat
block.

training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you

ing a Robe bearing certain colors or symbols.
Rope (1 GP)
As a Utilize action, you can tie a knot with Rope if
you succeed on a DC 0 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC
20 Strength (Athletics) check.
You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope
only if the creature has the Grappled, Incapacitated,
or Restrained condition. If the creature’s legs are
bound, the creature has the Restrained condition
until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the
creature to make a successful DC 5 Dexterity (Ac-
robatics) check as an action.
Sack (1 CP)
A Sack holds up to 30 pounds within cubic foot.
Scholar’s Pack (40 GP)
A Scholar’s Pack contains the following items: Back-

sheets of Parchment, and Tinderbox.
Shovel (2 GP)
Working for hour, you can use a Shovel to dig a
hole that is 5 feet on each side in soil or similar
material.
Signal Whistle (5 CP)
When blown as a Utilize action, a Signal Whistle
produces a sound that can be heard up to 600 feet
away.
Spell Scroll (Cantrip, 30 GP;
Level 1, 50 GP)
A Spell Scroll (Cantrip) or Spell Scroll (Level ) is a
magic item that bears the words of a cantrip or level
spell, respectively, determined by the scroll’s cre-
ator. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can
read the scroll and cast the spell using its normal
casting time and without providing any Material
components.
If the spell requires a saving throw or an attack
roll, the spell save DC is 3, and the attack bonus
is +5. The scroll disintegrates when the casting is
completed.

Spikes, Iron (1 GP)
Iron Spikes come in bundles of ten. As a Utilize
action, you can use a blunt object, such as a Light
Hammer, to hammer a spike into wood, earth, or a
similar material. You can do so to jam a door shut or
to then tie a Rope or Chain to the Spike.
Spyglass (1,000 GP)
Objects viewed through a Spyglass are magnified to
twice their size.
String (1 SP)
String is 0 feet long. You can tie a knot in it as a Uti-
lize action.
Tent (2 GP)
A Tent sleeps up to two Small or Medium creatures.
Tinderbox (5 SP)
A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire
steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light
oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a Candle,
Lamp, Lantern, or Torch—or anything else with
exposed uel—takes a Bonus Action. Lighting any
other fire takes 1 minute.
Torch (1 CP)
A Torch burns for hour, casting Bright Light in
a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional
20 feet. When you take the Attack action, you can
attack with the Torch, using it as a Simple Melee
weapon. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage.
Vial (1 GP)
A Vial holds up to 4 ounces.
Waterskin (2 SP)
A Waterskin holds up to 4 pints. If you don’t drink
suficient water, you risk dehydration (see “Rules
Glossary”).
Mounts and Vehicles
A mount can help you move more quickly through
the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry
gear that would otherwise slow you down. The
Mounts and Other Animals table shows each ani-
mal’s carrying capacity. See “Monsters” for the ani-
mals’ stat blocks.
Mounts and Cargo
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or
wagon can move weight up to five times its base
carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehi-
cle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, add
their carrying capacities together.
Barding
Barding is armor designed for a mount. Any type
of armor on the Armor table in “Equipment” can
be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the
normal cost, and it weighs twice as much.
Saddles
A saddle comes with a bit, a bridle, reins, and any
other equipment needed to use the saddle. A Mil-
itary Saddle gives Advantage on any ability check
you make to remain mounted. An Exotic Saddle is
required or riding an aquatic or a flying mount.

Large Vehicles
The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table pro-
vides statistics for various types of large vehicles.
The following notes apply.
Speed
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant cur-
rent, but they can be pulled upstream by draft an-
imals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and
weighs 00 pounds.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
101
Crew
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a
crew of skilled hirelings (see “Hirelings” later in
“Equipment”) to function. The minimum number of
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on
the type of ship, as shown in the table.
Passengers
The table lists the number of Small and Medium
passengers the ship can accommodate using ham-
mocks. A ship outfitted with private accommoda-
tions can carry one-fith as many passengers. A pas-
senger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but
prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private
cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.
Damage Threshold
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see “Rules Glos-
sary”), it’s noted in the table.
Ship Repair
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the
vessel is berthed. Repairing Hit Point of damage
requires day and costs 20 GP for materials and la-
bor. If the repairs are made in a location where sup-
plies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city
shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.
Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment
maintenance, and other necessities.
At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice),
choose a liestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor,
Modest, Comortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the
GM might take them into account when determining
risks or how others perceive your character.
Wretched (Free)
You survive via chance and charity. You’re often
exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping
outside.
Squalid (1 SP per Day)
You spend the bare minimum for your necessities.
You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and
opportunistic criminals.
Poor (2 SP per Day)
You spend frugally for your necessities.
Modest (1 GP per Day)
You support yourself at an average level.
Comfortable (2 GP per Day)
You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a
few luxuries.
Wealthy (4 GP per Day)
You’re accustomed to the finer things in lie and
might have servants.
Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)
You pay for the best and might have a staff that sup-
ports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and
might encourage you to share it, either legally or
otherwise.
Food, Drink, and Lodging
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for
food and a single night’s lodging. Prices for daily
lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle’s
expenses.

Magic Items
Adventures hold the promise—but not a guaran-
tee—ofinding magic items. Hundreds omagic
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this doc-
ument. Here’s what you need to know about using
magic items.
Identifying a Magic Item
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspic-
uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to
give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learn-
ing a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.
The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in
physical contact with the item. At the end of the
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them
(but not any curse the item might bear).
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop-
erties. The command word to activate a ring might
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design
might hint that it’s a Ring of Feather Falling.
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also
oer hints about its properties. In the specific case
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster
what a potion does. Other items might require more
experimentation. For example, if your character
puts on a Ring of Swimming, the GM might say, “Your
movement eels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then
dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would
then say you swim unexpectedly well.
Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them beore the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. With-
out becoming attuned to an item that requires At-
tunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits un-
less its description states otherwise. For example, a
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the
benefits oa normal Shield iyou aren’t attuned to
it, but none of its magical properties.
Attune during a Short Rest
Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short
Rest focused on only that item while being in physi-
cal contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the At-
tunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can
access its full magical capabilities.
No More Than Three Items
You can be attuned to no more than three magic
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than
one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to
more than one Ring of Protection at a time.
Ending Attunement
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item
has been more than 00 feet away for at least 24
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

System Reference Document 5.2.1
103
the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item
unless the item is cursed.
Wearing and Wielding Items
Using a magic item’s properties might mean wear-
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head,
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned,
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless osize or build.
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
Multiple Items of the Same Kind
You can’t wear more than one of certain magic
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.
Paired Items
Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot
gains no benefit rom either.
Crafting Nonmagical Items
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw ma-
terials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.
Tools
The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns
required tools for items not listed there.
You must use the required tool to make an item
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who
helps you must also have proficiency with it.
Raw Materials
To make an item, you need raw materials worth
half its purchase cost (round down). For example,
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate
Armor, which sells for ,500 GP. The GM determines
whether appropriate raw materials are available.
Time
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase
cost in GP by 0 (round a fraction up to a day). For
example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Cross-
bow, which sells for 50 GP.
If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t
be consecutive.
Characters can combine their efforts to shorten
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create
an item by the number of characters working on it.
Normally, only one other character can assist you,
but the GM might allow more assistants.
Brewing Potions of Healing
A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism
Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the
course of day (8 hours of work).
Scribing Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and cre-
ate a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.
Time and Cost
Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.
Prerequisites for the Scribe
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscrip-
tion. You must also have at hand any Material com-
ponents required by the spell; if the spell consumes
its Material components, they are consumed only
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
Cantrips
If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the
scroll works as if the caster were your level.

Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure
Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a
higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.
School of Magic
Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools
are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These cate-
gories help describe spells but have no rules of their
own, although some other rules refer to them.

Illusion

Necromancy

Class Spell Lists
If a spell is on a class’s spell list, the class’s name
appears in parentheses after the spell’s school of
magic. Some features add a spell to a character’s
spell list even if the character isn’t a member of a
class in the parentheses.
Casting Time
Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but
some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 
minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry speci-
fies which othose is required.
One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn
On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast
a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast
a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and
another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.
Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers
A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast
in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s
Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting
time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a
trigger defined in the spell.
Longer Casting Times
Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Rit-
ual—require more time to cast: minutes or even
hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of
minute or more, you must take the Magic action
on each of your turns, and you must maintain Con-
centration (see “Rules Glossary”) while you do so. If
your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you
don’t expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you
must start over.
Range
A spell’s range indicates how far from the spell-
caster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s
description specifies which part othe eect is lim-
ited by the range.
A range usually takes one of the following forms:
Distance. The range is expressed in feet.
Touch. The spell’s effect originates on something,
as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must
touch within their reach.
Self. The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates
rom them, as specified in the spell.
If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted
by its range unless the spell’s description says
otherwise.
Components
A spell’s components are physical requirements the
spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell’s
description indicates whether it requires Verbal
(V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the
spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s
components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell.
Verbal (V)
A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric
words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated.
The words must be uttered in a normal speaking
voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the
spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of
sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is
gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a
spell with a Verbal component.
Somatic (S)
A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation
or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must
use at least one of their hands to perform these
movements.
Material (M)
A Material component is a particular material used
in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in
the Components entry. These materials aren’t con-
sumed by the spell unless the spell’s description
states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand
free to access them, but it can be the same hand
used to perform Somatic components, if any.
If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and
doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use
a Component Pouch (see “Equipment”) instead of
providing the materials specified in the spell, or the

Alarm
Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
Duration: 8 hours
You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door,
a window, or an area within range that is no larger
than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm
alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters
the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can
designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You
also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:
Audible Alarm. The alarm produces the sound of
a handbell for 0 seconds within 60 feet of the
warded area.
Mental Alarm. You are alerted by a mental ping
if you are within mile of the warded area. This
ping awakens you if you’re asleep.
Alter Self
Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You alter your physical form. Choose one of the
following options. Its effects last for the duration,
during which you can take a Magic action to replace
the option you chose with a different one.
Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout gills and grow
webs between your fingers. You can breathe under-
water and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
Change Appearance. You alter your appear-
ance. You decide what you look like, including your
height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice,
hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing
characteristics. You can make yourself appear as
a member of another species, though none of your
statistics change. You can’t appear as a creature of a
different size, and your basic shape stays the same;
if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become
quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can
take a Magic action to change your appearance in
this way again.
Natural Weapons. You grow claws (Slashing),
fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Blud-
geoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to
deal damage with that new growth, it deals d6
damage of the type in parentheses instead of deal-
ing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike,
and you use your spellcasting ability modifier
for the attack and damage rolls rather than using
Strength.
Animal Friendship
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a morsel of food)
Duration: 24 hours
Target a Beast that you can see within range. The
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or

System Reference Document 5.2.1
108
or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the
spells ends.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can target
one additional Beast for each spell slot level above .
Animal Messenger
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a morsel of food)
Duration: 24 hours
A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within
range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw,
or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the
target’s Challenge Rating isn’t 0, it automatically
succeeds). You specify a location you have visited
and a recipient who matches a general descrip-
tion, such as “a person dressed in the uniform of
the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a
pointed hat.” You also communicate a message of
up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels or the
duration toward the specified location, covering
about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast
can fly.
When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message
to the creature that you described, mimicking your
communication. If the Beast doesn’t reach its desti-
nation before the spell ends, the message is lost, and
the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell’s dura-
tion increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level
above 2.
Animal Shapes
Level 8 Transmutation (Druid)
Casting Time: Action

Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours
Choose any number of willing creatures that you
can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into
a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a
Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a dif-
ferent form for each target. On later turns, you can
take a Magic action to transform the targets again.
A target’s game statistics are replaced by the
chosen Beast’s statistics, but the target retains its
creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment;
ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores. The target’s actions are lim-
ited by the Beast form’s anatomy, and it can’t cast
spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new
form, and the target can’t use any of that equipment
while in that form.
The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Hit Points othe first orm into
which it shape-shifts. These Temporary Hit Points
vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The trans-
formation lasts for the duration or until the target
ends it as a Bonus Action.
Animate Dead
Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of ﬂesh,
and a pinch of bone dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or
Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes
an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones
or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see “Monsters”
for the stat blocks).
On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Ac-
tion to mentally command any creature you made
with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of
you (if you control multiple creatures, you can
command any of them at the same time, issuing the
same command to each one). You decide what action
the creature will take and where it will move on
its next turn, or you can issue a general command,
such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue
no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action
and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order,
the creature continues to follow it until its task is
complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve
given it. To maintain control of the creature for an-
other 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the crea-
ture again before the current 24-hour period ends.
This use of the spell reasserts your control over up
to four creatures you have animated with this spell
rather than animating a new creature.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You animate or
reassert control over two additional Undead crea-
tures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the
creatures must come from a different corpse or pile
of bones.
Animate Objects
Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects animate at your command. Choose a num-
ber of nonmagical objects within range that aren’t
being worn or carried, aren’t fixed to a surace, and
aren’t Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects
is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; or
this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as

System Reference Document 5.2.1
109
one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge
target counts as three.
Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes
a Construct that uses the Animated Object stat
block; this creature is under your control until the
spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each
creature you make with this spell is an ally to you
and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative
count and takes its turn immediately after yours.
Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action
to mentally command any creature you made with
this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if
you control multiple creatures, you can command
any of them at the same time, issuing the same
command to each one). If you issue no commands,
the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only
to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit
Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remain-
ing damage carries over to that form.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The creature’s
Slam damage increases by d4 (Medium or smaller),
d6 (Large), or d2 (Huge) for each spell slot level
above 5.
or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons
through the barrier.
If you move so that an affected creature is forced
to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.
Antimagic Field
Level 8 Abjuration (Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (iron ﬁlings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 0-foot Em-
anation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions,
or create other magical effects inside the aura, and
those things can’t target or otherwise affect any-
thing inside it. Magical properties of magic items
don’t work inside the aura or on anything inside it.
Areas of effect created by spells or other magic
can’t extend into the aura, and no one can teleport
into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals
close temporarily while in the aura.
Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or
a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect
is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it
spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Dispel Magic has no effect on the aura, and the au-
ras created by different Antimagic Field spells don’t
nullify each other.
Antipathy/Sympathy
Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)
Duration: 10 days
As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates
antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or
object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom
saving throw when it comes within 20 feet of the
target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy deter-
mines what happens to a creature when it fails that
save:
Antipathy. The creature has the Frightened condi-
tion. The Frightened creature must use its move-
ment on its turns to get as far away as possible
from the target, moving by the safest route.
Sympathy. The creature has the Charmed condi-
tion. The Charmed creature must use its move-
ment on its turns to get as close as possible to the
target, moving by the safest route. If the creature
is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can’t
willingly move away. If the target damages the
Charmed creature, that creature can make a

Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as de-
scribed below.
Ending the Effect. If the Frightened or Charmed
creature ends its turn more than 20 feet away
from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom sav-
ing throw. On a successful save, the creature is no
longer affected by the target. A creature that suc-
cessfully saves against this effect is immune to it for
minute, after which it can be affected again.

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (an eggshell and a glove)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a Large hand of shimmering magical en-
ergy in an unoccupied space that you can see within
range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves
at your command, mimicking the movements of
your own hand.
The hand is an object that has AC 20 and Hit
Points equal to your Hit Point maximum. If it drops
to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. The hand doesn’t oc-
cupy its space.
When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action on
your later turns, you can move the hand up to 60
feet and then cause one of the following effects:
Clenched Fist. The hand strikes a target within 5
feet of it. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the
target takes 5d8 Force damage.
Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a Huge
or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target
must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or the
hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number
oeet equal to five times your spellcasting ability
modifier. The hand moves with the target, re-
maining within 5 feet of it.
Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a
Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The
target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw,
or the target has the Grappled condition, with an
escape DC equal to your spell save DC. While the
hand grapples the target, you can take a Bonus
Action to cause the hand to crush it, dealing Blud-
geoning damage to the target equal to 4d6 plus
your spellcasting ability modifier.
Interposing Hand. The hand grants you Half Cover
against attacks and other effects that originate
from its space or that pass through it. In addi-
tion, its space counts as Dificult Terrain or your

of the Grasping Hand increases by 2d6 for each spell
slot level above 5.

Arcanist’s Magic Aura
Level 2 Illusion (Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch

System Reference Document 5.2.1
111
Components: V, S, M (a small square of silk)
Duration: 24 hours
With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing crea-
ture or an object that isn’t being worn or carried. A
creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object
gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts
for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same
target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until
dispelled.
Mask (Creature). Choose a creature type other
than the target’s actual type. Spells and other magi-
cal effects treat the target as if it were a creature of
the chosen type.
False Aura (Object). You change the way the tar-
get appears to spells and magical effects that detect
magical auras, such as Detect Magic. You can make

Astral Projection
Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (for each of the spell’s targets,
one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth
100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled
You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane
(the spell ends instantly if you are already on that
plane). Each target’s body is left behind in a state of
suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condi-
tion, doesn’t need food or air, and doesn’t age.
A target’s astral form resembles its body in almost
every way, replicating its game statistics and pos-
sessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder
blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view
ater 1 oot. Ithe cord is cut—which happens only
when an eect states that it does so—the target’s
body and astral form both die.
A target’s astral form can travel through the As-
tral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that
plane, the target’s body and possessions travel
along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter
its body on the new plane.
Any damage or other effects that apply to an as-
tral form have no effect on the target’s body and
vice versa. If a target’s body or astral form drops to
0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell
ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to
dismiss it.
When the spell ends for a target who isn’t dead,
the target reappears in its body and exits the state
of suspended animation.

and it gains senses similar to a human’s. The GM
chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened
Plant, such as the statistics for the Awakened
Shrub or Awakened Tree in “Monsters.”

ture chooses its attitude toward you.

that has a casting time of an action, and that can
target you. You cast that spell—called the contin-
gent spell—as part ocasting Contingency, expend-
ing spell slots for both, but the contingent spell
doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect
when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that
trigger when you cast the two spells. For example,
a Contingency cast with Water Breathing might stip-
ulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when
you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
The contingent spell takes effect immediately af-
ter the trigger occurs or the first time, whether or
not you want it to, and then Contingency ends.
The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even
if it can normally target others. You can use only
one Contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell

ends. Also, Contingency ends on you if its material

a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic
action on your later turns, you can repeat the same
effect or choose a different one.
Flood. You cause the water level of all standing
water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you

System Reference Document 5.2.1

choose an area in a large body of water, you instead
create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side
of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge
or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehi-
cles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of
capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell
ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect
produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of
your next turn while the flood eect lasts.
Part Water. You part water in the area and cre-
ate a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s
area, and the separated water forms a wall to either
side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you
choose a dierent eect. The water then slowly fills
in the trench over the course of the next round until
the normal water level is restored.
Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the
area to move in a direction you choose, even if the
water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in
other unlikely directions. The water in the area
moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the
spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain.
The water continues to move in the direction you
chose until the spell ends or you choose a different
effect.
Whirlpool. You cause a whirlpool to form in the
center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet
square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until
you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The
whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet
wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the
water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled
0 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirl-
pool or the first time on a turn or ends its turn
there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning dam-
age. On a successful save, the creature takes half
as much damage. A creature can swim away from
the whirlpool only iit first takes an action to pull
away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check
against your spell save DC.

for each corpse)
Duration: Instantaneous
You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up
to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids
within range. Each one becomes a Ghoul under your
control (see “Monsters” for its stat block).
As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can
mentally command any creature you animated with
this spell if the creature is within 20 feet of you (if
you control multiple creatures, you can command
any of them at the same time, issuing the same com-
mand to them). You decide what action the creature
will take and where it will move on its next turn, or
you can issue a general command, such as to guard
a particular place. If you issue no commands, the
creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to
avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature con-
tinues to follow the order until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve
given it. To maintain control of the creature for an-
other 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the crea-
ture before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts your control over up to
three creatures you have animated with this spell
rather than animating new ones.

surface that you can see within range. This door can
be opened and closed, and it leads to a demiplane
that is an empty room 30 feet in each dimension,
made of wood or stone (your choice).
When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any
objects inside the demiplane remain there. Any
creatures inside also remain unless they opt to be
shunted through the door as it vanishes, landing
with the Prone condition in the unoccupied spaces
closest to the door’s former space.
Each time you cast this spell, you can create a
new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a
demiplane you created with a previous casting of

Read Thoughts. Target one creature you can see
within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within

get’s mind right now. If the target doesn’t know any
languages and isn’t telepathic, you learn nothing.
As a Magic action on your next turn, you can try
to probe deeper into the target’s mind. If you probe
deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, you discern the target’s reasoning,
emotions, and something that looms large in its
mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful
save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows
that you are probing into its mind, and until you
shift your attention away from the target’s mind,

Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save
DC, ending the spell on a success.

weapons, and other belongings on your person—
look different until the spell ends. You can seem
foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or
lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same
basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise,
the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold
up to physical inspection. For example, if you use
this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass
through the hat, and anyone who touches it would
feel nothing.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature must
take the Study action to inspect your appearance
and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC.

wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray
dust. The target can be revived only by a True Res-
urrection or a Wish spell.

be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an un-
willing creature, it can make a Constitution saving
throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.

and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops
returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or

gory—rom Medium to Small, or example. The tar-
get also has Disadvantage on Strength checks and

steed’s creature type—Celestial, Fey, or Fiend—
which determines certain traits in the stat block.

lies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, and
it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it
(as defined in the rules on mounted combat). Iyou

its turn immediately after yours and acts inde-
pendently, focusing on protecting you.

peared or a different one.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures
that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or
more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Ele-

another Forbiddance spell. If you cast Forbiddance
every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell
lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material compo-
nents are consumed on the last casting.

only partially within the area, or those too large to
fit inside it, are pushed away rom the center othe
area until they are completely outside it.
A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-
magical means. If the creature tries to use telepor-
tation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first
make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful

the target’s movement is unaected by Dificult
Terrain, and spells and other magical effects can
neither reduce the target’s Speed nor cause the tar-
get to have the Paralyzed or Restrained conditions.
The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.
In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of move-
ment to automatically escape from nonmagical
restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing
the Grappled condition on it.

Freezing Sphere
Level 6 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature crystal sphere)
Duration: Instantaneous
A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of
your choice within range, where it explodes in a
60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area
makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 0d6
Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the
water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet
square. This ice lasts for minute. Creatures that
were swimming on the surface of frozen water are
trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condi-
tion. A trapped creature can take an action to make
a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
DC to break free.
You can rerain rom firing the globe ater com-
pleting the spell’s casting. If you do so, a globe about
the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears
in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you
give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of
40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal
range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect
as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the
globe down without shattering it. After minute, if
the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in-
creases by d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

While in this form, the target’s only method
of movement is a Fly Speed of 0 feet, and it can
hover. The target can enter and occupy the space
of another creature. The target has Resistance to
Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has
Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Advan-
tage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving
throws. The target can pass through narrow open-
ings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid
surfaces.
The target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and
any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be
dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. Fi-
nally, the target can’t attack or cast spells.

Gate
Level 9 Conjuration (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 5,000+ GP)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space
you can see within range to a precise location on a
different plane of existence. The portal is a circular
opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diam-
eter. You can orient the portal in any direction you
choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the
portal’s destination is visible through it.
The portal has a front and a back on each plane
where it appears. Travel through the portal is possi-
ble only by moving through its front. Anything that
does so is instantly transported to the other plane,
appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the
portal.
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent por-
tals created by this spell from opening in their pres-
ence or anywhere within their domains.
When you cast this spell, you can speak the name
oa specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nick-
name doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane
other than the one you are on, the portal opens
next to the named creature and transports it to the
nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.
You gain no special power over the creature, and it
is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might
leave, attack you, or help you.

Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute

Components: V
Duration: 30 days
You give a verbal command to a creature that you
can see within range, ordering it to carry out some
service or refrain from an action or a course of ac-
tivity as you decide. The target must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condi-
tion for the duration. The target automatically suc-
ceeds if it can’t understand your command.
While Charmed, the creature takes 5d0 Psychic
damage if it acts in a manner directly counter to
your command. It takes this damage no more than
once each day.
You can issue any command you choose, short
of an activity that would result in certain death.
Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell
ends.
A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish spell
ends this spell.

7 or 8 spell slot, the duration is 365 days. If you use
a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by

consumes)
Duration: 10 days
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the dura-
tion, the target is protected from decay and can’t
become Undead.
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on
raising the target from the dead, since days spent
under the influence othis spell don’t count against
the time limit of spells such as Raise Dead.
Giant Insect
Level 4 Conjuration (Druid)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (cho-
sen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an un-
occupied space you can see within range and uses
the Giant Insect stat block. The form you choose
determines certain details in its stat block. The
creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or
when the spell ends.
The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In
combat, the creature shares your Initiative count,
but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It
obeys your verbal commands (no action required by
you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action
and uses its movement to avoid danger.

Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: 1 hour

check, you can replace the number you roll with a

Globe of Invulnerability
Level 6 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a glass bead)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 0-
foot Emanation around you and remains for the
duration.
Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the
barrier can’t affect anything within it. Such a spell
can target creatures and objects within the barrier,
but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the
area within the barrier is excluded from areas of
effect created by such spells.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The barrier
blocks spells of level higher for each spell slot level
above 6.
Glyph of Warding
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+
GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical
effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a
table or a section ofloor) or within an object that
can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal
the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger
than 0 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is
moved more than 0 feet from where you cast this
spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends with-
out being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell
glyph, as explained below.
Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the
glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
on a surface, common triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object cov-
ering it, or approaching within a certain distance of
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
triggers include opening that object or seeing the
glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
Explosive Rune. When triggered, the glyph erupts
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere cen-
tered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes
a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid,
Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your

System Reference Document 5.2.1
137
choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save
or half as much damage on a successful one.
Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of
level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of
creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect when cast in this way.
When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell
takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the
creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects
an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the
spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful
objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to
the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Con-
centration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage of
an explosive rune increases by d8 for each spell
slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can
store any spell of up to the same level as the spell
slot you use for the Glyph of Warding.

Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused

one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or
twenty-five 10-oot squares that are contiguous.
When you cast this spell, you can specify individu-
als that are unaffected by the spell’s effects. You can
also specify a password that, when spoken aloud
within 5 feet of the warded area, makes the speaker
immune to its effects.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
138
The spell creates the effects below within the
warded area. Dispel Magic has no effect on Guards
and Wards itself, but each of the following effects
can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled, Guards and
Wards ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365
days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts un-
til all its effects are dispelled.
Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors,
making them Heavily Obscured. In addition, at each
intersection or branching passage offering a choice
of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a
creature other than you believes it is going in the
opposite direction from the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are magically
locked, as if sealed by the Arcane Lock spell. In addi-
tion, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area rom
top to bottom, as in the Web spell. These strands
regrow in 0 minutes if they are destroyed while
Guards and Wards lasts.
Other Spell Effect. Place one of the following mag-
ical effects within the warded area:
• Dancing Lights in four corridors, with a simple
program that the lights repeat as long as Guards
and Wards lasts

that enters that square receives the suggestion
mentally

ture that ends its turn in the Line must make the

made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like
a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment,
and creatures within the area aren’t changed.
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are un-
changed, so creatures entering the area are likely
to notice the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious
by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take
the Study action to make an Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve
it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory,
the creature sees a vague image superimposed on
the real terrain.

material and imbue it with an illusion that lasts for
the duration. To you and any creatures you desig-
nate when you cast the spell, the writing appears
normal, seems to be written in your hand, and
conveys whatever meaning you intended when you
wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as
if it were written in an unknown or magical script
that is unintelligible. Alternatively, the illusion can

text, though the language must be one you know.

target is imprisoned. While imprisoned, the target
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t
age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the
imprisoned target, and the target can’t teleport.
Until the spell ends, the target is also affected by
one of the following effects of your choice:
Burial. The target is entombed beneath the earth
in a hollow globe of magical force that is just large
enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass
into or out of the globe.
Chaining. Chains firmly rooted in the ground hold
the target in place. The target has the Restrained
condition and can’t be moved by any means.
Hedged Prison. The target is trapped in a demi-
plane that is warded against teleportation and
planar travel. The demiplane is your choice of a
labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or the like.
Minimus Containment. The target becomes inch
tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gem-
stone or a similar object. Light can pass through
the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and
other creatures to see in), but nothing else can
pass through by any means.
Slumber. The target has the Unconscious condition
and can’t be awoken.
Ending the Spell. When you cast the spell, specify
a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as sim-
ple or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must
agree that it has a high likelihood of happening
within the next decade. The trigger must be an ob-
servable action, such as someone making a partic-
ular offering at the temple of your god, saving your
true love, or deeating a specific monster.

cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the
prison or the component used to create it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes
a Dexterity saving throw, taking 0d8 Fire damage

ible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the
object’s name on the sapphire. Each time you cast
this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak
the object’s name and crush the sapphire. The ob-
ject instantly appears in your hand regardless of
physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

ject, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport it, but
instead you learn who that creature is and where
that creature is currently located.

The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of
the significant lore about that amous thing, as de-
scribed by the GM.
The lore might consist of important details, amus-
ing revelations, or even secret lore that has never
been widely known. The more information you
already know about the thing, the more precise and
detailed the information you receive is. That infor-
mation is accurate but might be couched in figura-
tive language or poetry, as determined by the GM.

pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a
Constitution saving throw is unaffected.
The target can move only by pushing or pulling
against a fixed object or surace within reach (such
as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it
were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude
by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If
you are the target, you can move up or down as part
of your move. Otherwise, you can take a Magic ac-

Magic Jar
Level 6 Necromancy (Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth
500+ GP)
Duration: Until dispelled
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul
leaves it and enters the container you used for the
spell’s Material component. While your soul inhab-
its the container, you are aware of your surround-
ings as if you were in the container’s space. You
can’t move or take Reactions. The only action you
can take is to project your soul up to 00 feet out of
the container, either returning to your living body
(and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a
Humanoid’s body.
You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within
00 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded
by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle
spell can’t be possessed). The target makes a Cha-
risma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul en-
ters the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes
trapped in the container. On a successful save, the
target resists your efforts to possess it, and you
can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it.
Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the
creature’s. You otherwise keep your game statistics.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can per-
ceive from the container using its own senses, but it
can’t move and it is Incapacitated.
While possessing a body, you can take a Magic ac-
tion to return from the host body to the container if
it is within 00 feet of you, returning the host crea-
ture’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while
you’re in it, the creature dies, and you make a Cha-
risma saving throw against your own spellcasting
DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is
within 00 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends,
your soul returns to your body. If your body is more
than 00 feet away from you or if your body is dead,
you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container
when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to
its body if the body is alive and within 00 feet. Oth-
erwise, that creature dies.
When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.
Magic Missile

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet

several.

Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which
the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range—a
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is
met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t
being worn or carried by another creature. Then
speak the message, which must be 25 words or
fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 0
minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that
will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth ap-
pears on the object and recites the message in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the ob-
ject you chose has a mouth or something that looks
like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue),
the magical mouth appears there, so the words
appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you
cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it
delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its
message whenever the trigger occurs.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.
For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak
when any creature moves within 30 feet of the ob-
ject or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.
Magic Weapon

Wizard)

Magniﬁcent Mansion

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP)
Duration: 24 hours
You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts
for the duration. The door leads to an extradimen-
sional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 0 feet tall.
You and any creature you designate when you cast
the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling
as long as the door remains open. You can open or
close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet
of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.
Beyond the door is a magnificent oyer with
numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling’s atmo-
sphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any floor plan you like or the
dwelling, but it can’t exceed 50 contiguous 0-foot
Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you
choose. It contains suficient ood to serve a nine-
course banquet for up to 00 people. Furnishings
and other objects created by this spell dissipate into
smoke if removed from it.
A staff of 00 near-transparent servants attends
all who enter. You determine the appearance of
these servants and their attire. They are invulner-
able and obey your commands. Each servant can
perform tasks that a human could perform, but they
can’t attack or take any action that would directly
harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch
things, clean, mend, old clothes, light fires, serve
food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can’t leave
the dwelling.
When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left
inside the extradimensional space are expelled into
the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.
Major Image
Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of ﬂeece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger
than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
that you can see within range and lasts for the du-
ration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but
it can’t deal damage or cause conditions.
If you are within range of the illusion, you can
take a Magic action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For exam-
ple, if you create an image of a creature and move
it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to
make different sounds at different times, even mak-
ing it carry on a conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A crea-
ture that takes a Study action to examine the image
can determine that it is an illusion with a success-
ful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for
what it is, the creature can see through the image,
and its other sensory qualities become faint to the
creature.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell lasts
until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if
cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

Mass Suggestion
Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue)
Duration: 24 hours
You suggest a course oactivity—described in no
more than 25 words—to twelve or ewer creatures
you can see within range that can hear and under-
stand you. The suggestion must sound achievable
and not involve anything that would obviously deal
damage to any of the targets or their allies. For
example, you could say, “Walk to the village down
that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops
until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time
for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in
an hour.”
Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or have the Charmed condition for the dura-
tion or until you or your allies deal damage to the
target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion
to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can
continue for the entire duration, but if the sug-
gested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
the spell ends for a target upon completing it.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The duration is
longer with a spell slot of level 7 (0 days), 8 (30
days), or 9 (366 days).
Maze
Level 8 Conjuration (Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You banish a creature that you can see within range
into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains
there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.
The target can take a Study action to try to es-
cape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and
the spell ends.
When the spell ends, the target reappears in the
space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the near-
est unoccupied space.
Meld into Stone
Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours
You step into a stone object or surface large enough
to fully contain your body, merging yourself and
your equipment with the stone for the duration.
You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your
presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by
nonmagical senses.
While merged with the stone, you can’t see what
occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception)
checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made
with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the pas-
sage of time and can cast spells on yourself while
merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement
to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends
the spell. You otherwise can’t move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its
shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it)
expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The
stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into
a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force
damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoc-
cupied space closest to where you first entered and
have the Prone condition.
Mending

Duration: Instantaneous
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object
you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of
a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As
long as the break or tear is no larger than foot in
any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the
former damage.
This spell can physically repair a magic item, but
it can’t restore magic to such an object.
Message

Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet

Duration: 1 round

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You point toward a creature within range and
whisper a message. The target (and only the target)
hears the message and can reply in a whisper that
only you can hear.
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you
are familiar with the target and know it is beyond
the barrier. Magical silence; foot of stone, metal,
or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.
Meteor Swarm
Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Blazing orbs ofire plummet to the ground at our
different points you can see within range. Each
creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on
each of those points makes a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6
Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature in the
area omore than one fiery Sphere is aected only
once.
A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or car-
ried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area,
and the object starts burning iit’s flammable.
Mind Blank
Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch
has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed
condition. The target is also unaffected by anything
that would sense its emotions or alignment, read
its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and
no spell—not even Wish—can gather inormation
about the target, observe it remotely, or control its
mind.
Mind Spike
Level 2 Divination (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of
one creature you can see within range. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one. On a failed save, you also always
know the target’s location until the spell ends, but
only while the two of you are on the same plane
of existence. While you have this knowledge, the
target can’t become hidden from you, and if it has
the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit rom that
condition against you.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in-
creases by d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
Minor Illusion
Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a bit of ﬂeece)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within
range that lasts for the duration. See the descrip-
tions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends
if you cast this spell again.
If a creature takes a Study action to examine the
sound or image, the creature can determine that it
is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check against your spell save DC. If a crea-
ture discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion
becomes faint to the creature.
Sound. If you create a sound, its volume can range
from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice,
someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of
drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound
continues unabated throughout the duration, or you
can make discrete sounds at different times before
the spell ends.
Image. Iyou create an image oan object—such
as a chair, muddy ootprints, or a small chest—it
must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image
can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory
effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.
Mirage Arcane
Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Sight
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 days
You make terrain in an area up to mile square
look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other
sort oterrain. Open fields or a road could be made
to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other
rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to
seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of struc-
tures or add them where none are present. The spell
doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground

System Reference Document 5.2.1
150
into Dificult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise
impede movement through the area. Any piece
of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick)
that is removed from the spell’s area disappears
immediately.
Creatures with Truesight can see through the illu-
sion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other el-
ements of the illusion remain, so while the creature
is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can
still physically interact with the illusion.
Mirror Image
Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s
impossible to track which image is real.
Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll
during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of
your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls
a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of
you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates
otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The
spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the
Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.
Mislead
Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You gain the Invisible condition at the same time
that an illusory double of you appears where you
are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but
the invisibility ends immediately after you make an
attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
As a Magic action, you can move the illusory dou-
ble up to twice your Speed and make it gesture,
speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is
intangible and invulnerable.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its
ears as if you were located where it is.
Misty Step
Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up
to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
Modify Memory
Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature’s mem-
ories. One creature that you can see within range
makes a Wisdom saving throw. Iyou are fighting
the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a
failed save, the target has the Charmed condition
for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the
target also has the Incapacitated condition and is
unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another
spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.
While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s
memory of an event that it experienced within the
last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 0 min-
utes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of
the event, allow the target to recall the event with
perfect clarity, change its memory of the event’s de-
tails, or create a memory of some other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how its
memories are affected, and it must be able to under-
stand your language or the modified memories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details o
your description. Ithe spell ends beore you finish
describing the modified memories, the creature’s
memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified
memories take hold when the spell ends.
A modified memory doesn’t necessarily aect
how a creature behaves, particularly if the mem-
ory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations,
alignment, or belies. An illogical modified memory,
such as a false memory of how much the creature
enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad
dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too
nonsensical to affect a creature.
A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast
on the target restores the creature’s true memory.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can alter the
target’s memories of an event that took place up to
7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7
spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any
time in the creature’s past (level 9 spell slot).
Moonbeam
Level 2 Evocation (Druid)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

System Reference Document 5.2.1
151
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a
5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a
point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light
fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on
later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.
When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it
makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature takes 2d0 Radiant damage, and if the
creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Poly-
morph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form
and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage only. A creature also makes this save when
the spell’s area moves into its space and when it
enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A crea-
ture makes this save only once per turn.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in-
creases by d0 for each spell slot level above 2.
Move Earth
Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature shovel)
Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on
a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or
clay in the area in any manner you choose for the
duration. You can raise or lower the area’s eleva-
tion, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall,
or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes
can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For
example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can
create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the
square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 0 minutes for
these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s
transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area
can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s
movement.
At the end of every 0 minutes you spend concen-
trating on the spell, you can choose a new area of
terrain to affect within range.
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone
construction. Rocks and structures shift to accom-
modate the new terrain. If the way you shape the
terrain would make a structure unstable, it might
collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant
growth. The moved earth carries any plants along
with it.
Nondetection
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Ranger, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth
25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 8 hours
For the duration, you hide a target that you touch
from Divination spells. The target can be a willing
creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger
than 0 feet in any dimension. The target can’t
be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived
through magical scrying sensors.
Passwall
Level 5 Transmutation (Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
Duration: 1 hour
A passage appears at a point that you can see on a
wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall,
ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts or the dura-
tion. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5
feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage
creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
When the opening disappears, any creatures or
objects still in the passage created by the spell are
safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the
surface on which you cast the spell.
Pass without Trace
Level 2 Abjuration (Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (ashes from burned mistletoe)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You radiate a concealing aura in a 30-foot Emana-
tion for the duration. While in the aura, you and
each creature you choose have a +0 bonus to Dex-
terity (Stealth) checks and leave no tracks.
Phantasmal Force
Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of ﬂeece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a
creature you can see within range. The target
makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or
other phenomenon that is no larger than a 0-foot
Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for
the duration. The phantasm includes sound, tem-
perature, and other stimuli.
The target can take a Study action to examine the
phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds,

System Reference Document 5.2.1
152
the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion,
and the spell ends.
While affected by the spell, the target treats the
phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any il-
logical outcomes from interacting with it. For exam-
ple, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge
and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists
and something else caused it to fall.
An affected target can even take damage from
the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous
creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a
phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the tar-
get if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of
the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a
type appropriate to the illusion.
Phantasmal Killer
Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can
see within range and create an illusion of its deep-
est fears, visible only to that creature. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
target takes 4d0 Psychic damage and has Disad-
vantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the
duration. On a successful save, the target takes half
as much damage, and the spell ends.
For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom sav-
ing throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed
save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a suc-
cessful save, the spell ends.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in-
creases by d0 for each spell slot level above 4.
Phantom Steed
Level 3 Illusion (Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on
the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
within range. You decide the creature’s appearance,
and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 0 feet away
from the steed.
For the duration, you or a creature you choose
can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse
stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of
00 feet and can travel 3 miles in an hour. When
the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the
rider minute to dismount. The spell ends early if
the steed takes any damage.
Planar Ally
Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The be-
ing must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or
some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends
a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid
you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied
space within range. Iyou know a specific creature’s
name, you can speak that name when you cast this
spell to request that creature, though you might get
a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).
When the creature appears, it is under no com-
pulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it
to perform a service in exchange for payment, but
it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could
range rom simple (fly us across the chasm, or help
us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or
protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You
must be able to communicate with the creature to
bargain for its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial
might require a sizable donation of gold or magic
items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might de-
mand a living sacrifice or a git otreasure. Some
creatures might exchange their service for a quest
undertaken by you.
A task that can be measured in minutes requires a
payment worth 00 GP per minute. A task measured
in hours requires ,000 GP per hour. And a task
measured in days (up to 0 days) requires 0,000
GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments
based on the circumstances under which you cast
the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s
ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.
Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the
suggested payment, while especially dangerous
tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely
accept tasks that seem suicidal.
After the creature completes the task, or when the
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the crea-
ture returns to its home plane after reporting back
to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a
price for the creature’s service, the creature imme-
diately returns to its home plane.
Planar Binding
Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock,
Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a jewel worth 1,000+ GP, which
the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours

System Reference Document 5.2.1
153
You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a
Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must
be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
(Typically, the creature is first summoned into the
center of the inverted version of the Magic Circle
spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the com-
pletion of the casting, the target must succeed on
a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you
for the duration. If the creature was summoned or
created by another spell, that spell’s duration is ex-
tended to match the duration of this spell.
A bound creature must follow your commands
to the best of its ability. You might command the
creature to accompany you on an adventure, to
guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the
creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your com-
mands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature
carries out your commands completely before the
spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you
are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a
different plane, it returns to the place where you
bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The duration
increases with a spell slot of level 6 (0 days), 7 (30
days), 8 (80 days), and 9 (366 days).
Plane Shift
Level 7 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock,
Wizard)
Casting Time: Action

GP and attuned to a plane of existence)
Duration: Instantaneous
You and up to eight willing creatures who link
hands in a circle are transported to a different plane
of existence. You can specify a target destination in
general terms, such as a specific city on the Elemen-
tal Plane of Fire or palace on the second level of the
Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destina-
tion, as determined by the GM.
Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a
teleportation circle on another plane of existence,
this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleporta-
tion circle is too small to hold all the creatures you
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied
spaces next to the circle.
Plant Growth
Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action (Overgrowth) or
8 hours (Enrichment)
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting
time you use determines whether the spell has the
Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.
Overgrowth. Choose a point within range. All
normal plants in a 00-foot-radius Sphere centered
on that point become thick and overgrown. A crea-
ture moving through that area must spend 4 feet of
movement for every foot it moves. You can exclude
one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area
from being affected.
Enrichment. All plants in a half-mile radius cen-
tered on a point within range become enriched for
365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount
oood when harvested. They can benefit rom only
one Plant Growth per year.
Poison Spray
Necromancy Cantrip (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock,
Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet

(4d2).
Polymorph
Level 4 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You attempt to transform a creature that you can
see within range into a Beast. The target must suc-
ceed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into
a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any
Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal
to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level if
it doesn’t have a Challenge Rating). The target’s
game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the
chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment,
personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point
Dice. See the “Animals” section of “Monsters” for a
sample of Beast stat blocks.
The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form.
These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain
when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the tar-
get if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.
The target is limited in the actions it can perform
by the anatomy of its new form, and it can’t speak or
cast spells.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The
creature can’t use or otherwise benefit rom any o
that equipment.
Power Word Heal
Level 9 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Component: V
Duration: Instantaneous
A wave of healing energy washes over one creature
you can see within range. The target regains all its
Hit Points. If the creature has the Charmed, Fright-
ened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned condition,

up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within
range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you posi-
tion the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the
spell ends instantly without effect.
The wall sheds Bright Light within 00 feet and
Dim Light for an additional 00 feet. You and crea-
tures you designate when you cast the spell can
pass through and be near the wall without harm. If
another creature that can see the wall moves within
20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or
have the Blinded condition for minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a
different color. When a creature reaches into or
passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a

creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be af-
fected by that layer’s properties as described in the
Prismatic Layers table.
The wall, which has AC 0, can be destroyed one
layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means

You make an area within range magically secure.
The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to
as large as 00 feet on each side. The spell lasts for
the duration.
When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of
security the spell provides, choosing any of the fol-
lowing properties:
• Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge
of the warded area.
• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and
foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision)
through it.

inside the protected area or pass through the bar-
rier at its perimeter.
• Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by Divina-
tion spells.
• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded
area.
• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Produce Flame
Conjuration Cantrip (Druid)
Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: Self

emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds
Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an

hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 eet o
you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target
takes d8 Fire damage.

Programmed Illusion
Level 6 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP)
Duration: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon within range that
activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illu-
sion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger
than a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast
the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds
it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5
minutes.
When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion
springs into existence and performs in the manner
you described. Once the illusion finishes perorm-
ing, it disappears and remains dormant for 0 min-
utes, after which the illusion can be activated again.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area.
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself
to appear and warn off others who attempt to open
a trapped door.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes the Study action to examine
the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illu-
sion for what it is, the creature can see through the
image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
creature.

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for
the duration. The copy can appear at any location
within range that you have seen before, regardless
of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and
sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion
takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can see through the illusion’s eyes and hear
through its ears as if you were in its space. As a
Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and
make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way
you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe
there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a
creature or object inside can’t be damaged by at-
tacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a
creature inside the sphere damage anything outside
it.
The sphere is weightless and just large enough to
contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed
creature can take an action to push against the

avoiding the fall upward.
If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered
in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it

taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target’s new
appearance must have the same basic arrangement
of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion

is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the
duration.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up
to physical inspection. For example, if you use this
spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass
through the hat.
A creature that takes the Study action to examine
a target can make an Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it
becomes aware that the target is disguised.
Sending
Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Unlimited
Components: V, S, M (a copper wire)
Duration: Instantaneous
You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to
a creature you have met or a creature described to
you by someone who has met it. The target hears
the message in its mind, recognizes you as the
sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately. The spell enables targets to
understand the meaning of your message.
You can send the message across any distance and
even to other planes of existence, but if the target
is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent
chance that the message doesn’t arrive. You know if
the delivery fails.
Upon receiving your message, a creature can
block your ability to reach it again with this spell for
8 hours. If you try to send another message during
that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the
spell fails.
Sequester

Casting Time: Action

With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a
willing creature. For the duration, the target has the
Invisible condition and can’t be targeted by Divina-
tion spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely
with magic.
If the target is a creature, it enters a state of sus-
pended animation; it has the Unconscious condition,
doesn’t age, and doesn’t need food, water, or air.
You can set a condition for the spell to end early.
The condition can be anything you choose, but it
must occur or be visible within mile of the target.

tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the tar-
get takes any damage.

into a different eligible form. The new form must be
of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher
than your level or Challenge Rating. You must have
seen the sort of creature before, and it can’t be a
Construct or an Undead.
When you cast the spell, you gain a number of
Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the
first orm into which you shape-shit. These Tempo-
rary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell
ends.
Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block
of the chosen form, but you retain your creature
type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; pro-
ficiencies; and ability to communicate. Iyou have
the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.
Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your
equipment drops to the ground or changes in size
and shape to fit the new orm while you’re in it.

Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (mistletoe)
Duration: 1 minute
A Club or Quarterstaff you are holding is imbued
with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use
your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the
attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that
weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes
a d8. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force
damage or the weapon’s normal damage type (your
choice).
The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let
go of the weapon.
Cantrip Upgrade. The damage die changes when
you reach levels 5 (d0), (d2), and 7 (2d6).

ately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or
an Unarmed Strike
Range: Self
Component: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
The target hit by the strike takes an extra 2d6 Radi-

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, no sound can be created within
or pass through a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered
on a point you choose within range. Any creature
or object entirely inside the Sphere has Immunity
to Thunder damage, and creatures have the Deaf-
ened condition while entirely inside it. Casting a
spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible
there.
Silent Image
Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of ﬂeece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger
than a 5-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
within range and lasts for the duration. The image
is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound,
smell, or other sensory effects.
As a Magic action, you can cause the image
to move to any spot within range. As the image
changes location, you can alter its appearance so
that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature
and move it, you can alter the image so that it ap-
pears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes a Study action to examine the
image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illu-
sion for what it is, the creature can see through the
image.
Simulacrum
Level 7 Illusion (Wizard)
Casting Time: 12 hours
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled

System Reference Document 5.2.1
163
You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid
that is within 0 feet of you for the entire casting of
the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the
creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same
size as that creature, and the pile turns into the
simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game
statistics of the original creature at the time of cast-
ing, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum
is half as much, and it can’t cast this spell.
The simulacrum is Friendly to you and creatures
you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on
your turn in combat. The simulacrum can’t gain lev-
els, and it can’t take Short or Long Rests.
If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way
to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a
Long Rest, during which you expend components
worth 00 GP per Hit Point restored. The simula-
crum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.
The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points,
at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If
you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you cre-
ated with this spell is instantly destroyed.
Sleep
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius
Sphere centered on a point within range must suc-
ceed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Inca-
pacitated condition until the end of its next turn,
at which point it must repeat the save. If the target
fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious
condition for the duration. The spell ends on a tar-
get if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it
takes an action to shake it out of the spell’s effect.
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, or that
have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition auto-
matically succeed on saves against this spell.
Sleet Storm
Level 3 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

Components: V, S, M (a miniature umbrella)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall,
20-foot-radius Cylinder centered on a point you
choose within range. The area is Heavily Obscured,
and exposed flames in the area are doused.
Ground in the Cylinder is Dificult Terrain. When
a creature enters the Cylinder or the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition
and lose Concentration.
Slow
Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You alter time around up to six creatures of your
choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be af-
fected by this spell for the duration.
An aected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2
penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it
can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either
an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can
make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If
it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is
a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the
target making the spell’s gestures too slowly.
An affected target repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a
success.
Sorcerous Burst
Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Component: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object
within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes d8 damage of a
type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison,
Psychic, or Thunder.
If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll
another d8, and add it to the damage. When you cast
this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you
can add to the spell’s damage equals your spellcast-
ing ability modifier.
Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by d8
when you reach levels 5 (2d8), (3d8), and 7
(4d8).
Spare the Dying
Necromancy Cantrip (Cleric, Druid)

Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally
communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of
the Influence action’s skill options with them.

nearby locations and monsters, including whatever
it has perceived within the past day.
Speak with Dead
Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (burning incense)
Duration: 10 minutes
You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your
choice within range, allowing it to answer ques-
tions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and
this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead
when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was
the target of this spell within the past 0 days.
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to
five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew
in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are
usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse
is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if
you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you
as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s
soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the
corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t compre-
hend anything that has happened since it died, and
can’t speculate about future events.
Speak with Plants
Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
You imbue plants in an immobile 30-foot Emanation
with limited sentience and animation, giving them
the ability to communicate with you and follow your
simple commands. You can question plants about
events in the spell’s area within the past day, gain-
ing information about creatures that have passed,
weather, and other circumstances.
You can also turn Dificult Terrain caused by plant
growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into
ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you
can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present
into Dificult Terrain that lasts or the duration.
The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot them-
selves and move about, but they can move their
branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.
If a Plant creature is in the area, you can commu-
nicate with it as if you shared a common language.
Spider Climb
Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

gains the ability to move up, down, and across
vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving
its hands free. The target also gains a Climb Speed

one additional creature for each spell slot level

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered
on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and
thorns. The area becomes Dificult Terrain or the
duration. When a creature moves into or within the
area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it
travels.
The transormation othe ground is camouflaged
to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area
when the spell is cast must take a Search action
and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival)
check against your spell save DC to recognize the
terrain as hazardous before entering it.
Spirit Guardians
Level 3 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a prayer scroll)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-oot Ema-
nation for the duration. If you are good or neutral,
their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your
choice). Iyou are evil, they appear fiendish.
When you cast this spell, you can designate crea-
tures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature’s
Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the
Emanation enters a creature’s space and whenever

System Reference Document 5.2.1
165
a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn
there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Ra-
diant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Ne-
crotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save,
the creature takes half as much damage. A creature
makes this save only once per turn.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in-
creases by d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
Spiritual Weapon

Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a floating, spectral orce that resembles
a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration.

choice, and you can immediately make one melee
spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the
force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal
to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can
move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack
against a creature within 5 feet of it.

produces different effects, as detailed below.
Turn 2. Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object
under the cloud takes 4d6 Acid damage.

more than 25 words—to one creature you can see
within range that can hear and understand you.
The suggestion must sound achievable and not in-
volve anything that would obviously deal damage
to the target or its allies. For example, you could
say, “Fetch the key to the cult’s treasure vault, and
give the key to me.” Or you could say, “Stop fighting,
leave this library peacefully, and don’t return.”
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or have the Charmed condition for the dura-
tion or until you or your allies deal damage to the
target. The Charmed target pursues the suggestion

dragon engraved on it worth 500+ GP)

occupied space that you can see within range and
uses the Draconic Spirit stat block. The creature
disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when

Symbol
Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+
GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface
(such as a section ofloor or wall) or within an ob-
ject that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The
glyph can cover an area no larger than 0 feet in
diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in
place; if it is moved more than 0 feet from where
you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell
ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death,
Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is
explained below.
Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the
glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
on a surface, common triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object cov-
ering it, or approaching within a certain distance of
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
triggers include opening that object or seeing the
glyph.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 0
minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You gain the ability to move or manipulate crea-
tures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell
and as a Magic action on your later turns before the
spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature
or object that you can see within range, causing the
appropriate effect below. You can affect the same

creature. The target must succeed on a Strength
saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any
direction within the spell’s range. Until the end of

dition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended
there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you
use this option on it again and it fails the save.
Object. You can try to move a Huge or smaller
object. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you
automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction
within the spell’s range.

The destination you choose must be known to
you, and it must be on the same plane of existence
as you. Your familiarity with the destination deter-
mines whether you arrive there successfully. The
GM rolls d00 and consults the Teleportation Out-

Familiarity. Here are the meanings of the terms
in the table’s Familiarity column:
• “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleporta-
tion circle whose sigil sequence you know.
• “Linked object” means you possess an object taken
from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard’s library.
• “Very familiar” is a place you have visited often,
a place you have carefully studied, or a place you
can see when you cast the spell.
• “Seen casually” is a place you have seen more
than once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
• “Viewed once or described” is a place you have
seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you
know through someone else’s description, per-
haps from a map.
• “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but
instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting
to teleport to a location that no longer exists.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in
a dificult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the
target object) takes 3d0 Force damage, and the GM
rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (mul-
tiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
Similar Area. You and your group (or the target
object) appear in a different area that’s visually or
thematically similar to the target area. You appear
in the closest similar place. If you are heading for
your home laboratory, for example, you might ap-
pear in another person’s laboratory in the same city.
Off Target. You and your group (or the target ob-
ject) appear 2d2 miles away from the destination
in a random direction. Roll d8 for the direction: ,
east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6,
northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.
On Target. You and your group (or the target ob-
ject) appear where you intended.
Teleportation Circle
Level 5 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, M (rare inks worth 50+ GP, which the
spell consumes)
Duration: 1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle
on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your
location to a permanent teleportation circle of your
choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is
on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmer-
ing portal opens within the circle you drew and
remains open until the end of your next turn. Any
creature that enters the portal instantly appears
within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the near-
est unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
169
Many major temples, guildhalls, and other import-
ant places have permanent teleportation circles.
Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a
string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.
When you first gain the ability to cast this spell,
you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations
on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You
might learn additional sigil sequences during your
adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to
memory after studying it for minute.
You can create a permanent teleportation circle
by casting this spell in the same location every day
for 365 days.

A 0-foot Emanation springs into existence around

enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.
Creatures and objects within the Emanation
when you cast the spell can move through it freely.
All other creatures and objects are barred from
passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can’t be
cast through it, and the effects of such spells can’t
extend into it.
The atmosphere inside the Emanation is comfort-
able and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until
the spell ends, you can command the interior to have
Dim Light or Darkness (no action required). The Em-
anation is opaque from the outside and of any color
you choose, but it’s transparent from the inside.

a different creature or a nonmagical object, or the
object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must
be neither worn nor carried). The transformation
lasts for the duration or until the target dies or is
destroyed, but if you maintain Concentration on
this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until
dispelled.
An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving
throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.
Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature
into another kind of creature, the new form can be
any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating
equal to or less than the target’s Challenge Rating
or level. The target’s game statistics are replaced by
the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit
Points, Hit Point Dice, alignment, and personality.
The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Hit Points of the new form.
These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain
when the spell ends.
The target is limited in the actions it can perform

that equipment.
Object into Creature. You can turn an object into
any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size
is no larger than the object’s size and the creature
has a Challenge Rating of 9 or lower. The creature is
Friendly to you and your allies. In combat, it takes
its turns immediately after yours, and it obeys your
commands.
If the spell lasts more than an hour, you no longer
control the creature. It might remain Friendly to
you, depending on how you have treated it.
Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into
an object, it transforms along with whatever it is
wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the

form after the spell ends and it returns to normal.

diant damage or the weapon’s normal damage type
(your choice).

wall lasts for the duration.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d0 Blud-
geoning damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
At the start of each of your turns after the wall
appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it,
moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller
creature inside the wall or whose space the wall
enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength
saving throw or take 5d0 Bludgeoning damage. A
creature can take this damage only once per round.
At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced
by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later
rounds is reduced by d0. When the wall reaches 0
feet in height, the spell ends.
A creature caught in the wall can move by swim-
ming. Because of the wave’s force, though, the crea-
ture must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check
against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails
the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out
of the wall falls to the ground.

Points, the spell ends.
Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you
can mentally command the servant to move up to
5 feet and interact with an object. The servant can
perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as
fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes,
lighting fires, serving ood, and pouring drinks.
Once you give the command, the servant performs
the task to the best of its ability until it completes
the task, then waits for your next command.

spell ends.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at
a point you choose within range. The wall appears
in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be ree floating
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a
hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up
to 10 eet, or you can shape a flat surace made up
of ten 0-foot-by-0-foot panels. Each panel must
be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the
wall is /4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If
the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it ap-
pears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
(you choose which side).
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It

the wall.
Wall of Ice
Level 6 Evocation (Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of quartz)

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within
range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome
or a globe with a radius of up to 0 feet, or you can
shape a flat surace made up oten 10-oot-square
panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another
panel. In any form, the wall is foot thick and lasts
for the duration.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the
wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 0d6 Cold damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and
thus breached. It has AC 2 and 30 Hit Points per
0-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poi-
son, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire
damage. Reducing a 0-foot section of wall to 0 Hit
Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid
air in the space the wall occupied.
A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air
or the first time on a turn makes a Constitution
saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Wall of Stone
Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a cube of granite)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into exis-
tence at a point you choose within range. The wall
is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 0-foot-by-
0-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
another panel. Alternatively, you can create 0-foot-
by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the
wall (you choose which side). If a creature would
be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall
and another solid surface), that creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its
Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no lon-
ger enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it
can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on a firm
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can
use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length,
you must halve the size of each panel to create sup-
ports. You can crudely shape the wall to create bat-
tlements and the like.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be
damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 5
and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has
Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing
a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause
connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.
If you maintain your Concentration on this spell
for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent
and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disap-
pears when the spell ends.
Wall of Thorns

high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot
diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.
The wall blocks line of sight.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Pierc-
ing damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
A creature can move through the wall, albeit
slowly and painfully. For every foot a creature
moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature
enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn
there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw,
taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half
as much damage on a successful one. A creature
makes this save only once per turn.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Both types of
damage increase by d8 for each spell slot level

saving throws, and it has Resistance to all damage.
Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same
amount of damage.
The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you
and the target become separated by more than 60
feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of
the connected creatures.
Water Breathing
Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer,
Wizard)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a short reed)
Duration: 24 hours
This spell grants up to ten willing creatures of your
choice within range the ability to breathe under-
water until the spell ends. Affected creatures also
retain their normal mode of respiration.
Water Walk
Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet

System Reference Document 5.2.1
174
Components: V, S, M (a piece of cork)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid
surace—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand,
or lava—as iit were harmless solid ground (crea-
tures crossing molten lava can still take damage
from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your
choice within range gain this ability for the duration.
An affected target must take a Bonus Action to
pass from the liquid’s surface into the liquid itself
and vice versa, but if the target falls into the liquid,
the target passes through the surface into the liquid
below.
Web
Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point
within range. The webs fill a 20-oot Cube there or
the duration. The webs are Dificult Terrain, and the
area within them is Lightly Obscured.
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid
masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across
a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itsel,
and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
Webs layered over a flat surace have a depth o5
feet.
The first time a creature enters the webs on a
turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained con-
dition while in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature Restrained by the webs can take an
action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against
your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
Restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-oot Cube owebs
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4
Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in
the fire.
Weird
Level 9 Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You try to create illusory terrors in others’ minds.
Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius
Sphere centered on a point within range makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target
takes 0d0 Psychic damage and has the Frightened
condition for the duration. On a successful save, a
target takes half as much damage only.
A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed
save, it takes 5d0 Psychic damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends on that target.
Wind Walk
Level 6 Transmutation (Druid)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a candle)
Duration: 8 hours
You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice
within range assume gaseous forms for the du-
ration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this
cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and
can hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition;
and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take
in this form are the Dash action or a Magic action to
begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes
minute, during which the target has the Stunned
condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert
to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action
followed by a -minute transformation.
Ia target is in cloud orm and flying when the e-
fect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for
minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t
land after minute, it falls the remaining distance.
Wind Wall
Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a fan and a feather)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a
point you choose within range. You can make the
wall up to 50 feet long, 5 feet high, and foot
thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose
so long as it makes one continuous path along the
ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Blud-
geoning damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other
gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or
objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, light-
weight materials brought into the wall fly upward.
Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles
launched at targets behind the wall are deflected
upward and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by
Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are
unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass
through it.

Wish
Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other
spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you
don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that
spell, including costly components. The spell simply
takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following
effects of your choice:
Object Creation. You create one object of up to
25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The
object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimen-
sion, and it appears in an unoccupied space that
you can see on the ground.
Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to
twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit
Points, and you end all effects on them listed in
the Greater Restoration spell.
Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you
can see Resistance to one damage type that you
choose. This Resistance is permanent.
Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you
can see immunity to a single spell or other magi-
cal effect for 8 hours.
Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with
another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all
the benefits othe old eat and gain the benefits o
the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a pre-
requisite for any of your other feats or features.
Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing
a reroll of any die roll made within the last round
(including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish
spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a
foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made
with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not
included in any of the other effects. To do so, state
your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The
GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in
such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater
the likelihood that something goes wrong. This
spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might
be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a
villain were dead might propel you forward in
time to a period when that villain is no longer
alive, effectively removing you from the game.
Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or
an Artifact might instantly transport you to the
presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish
is granted and its effects have consequences for a
whole community, region, or world, you are likely
to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect
a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly in-
tervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft
the wish in a particular way. If your wish would
undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails.
The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
After enduring that stress, each time you cast a
spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10
Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage
can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addi-
tion, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days.
For each of those days that you spend resting and
doing nothing more than light activity, your remain-
ing recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there
is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast
Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.
Word of Recall
Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You and up to five willing creatures within 5 eet
of you instantly teleport to a previously designated
sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with
you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the
spot you designated when you prepared your sanc-
tuary (see below). Iyou cast this spell without first
preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.
You must designate a location, such as a temple, as
a sanctuary by casting this spell there.
Zone of Truth
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
You create a magical zone that guards against de-
ception in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a
point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature
that enters the spell’s area or the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma sav-
ing throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a
deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether
a creature succeeds or fails on this save.
An affected creature is aware of the spell and
can avoid answering questions to which it would
normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be
evasive yet must be truthful.

Rules Glossary
Glossary Conventions
The glossary uses the following conventions:
Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brack-
ets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].”
A tag—Action, Area oEect, Attitude, Condition,
or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part oa amily
of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.
“You.” The game’s rules—in this glossary and else-
where—oten talk about something happening
to you in the game world. That “you” refers to
the creature or object that the rule applies to in a
particular moment of play. For example, the “you”
in the Prone condition is a creature that currently
has that condition.
“See Also.” Some glossary entries include a See also
section that points to other entries in the glossary,
to other parts of this document, or both.
No Obsolete Terms. The glossary contains defini-
tions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking
or a term rom an earlier version othe fith edi-
tion rules, consult the index.

Rules Deﬁnitions
Here are definitions ovarious rules.
Ability Check
An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using
one othe six abilities—or a specific skill associated
with an ability—to overcome a challenge. See also
“Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests” and “Proficiency”).
Ability Score and Modiﬁer
A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dex-
terity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma—each owhich has a corresponding mod-
ifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test
with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks
you to do so. See also “Playing the Game” (“The Six
Abilities”).
Action
On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which
action to take from those below or from the special
actions provided by your features. See also “Playing
the Game” (“Actions”). These actions are defined
elsewhere in this glossary:
Attack
Dash
Disengage
Dodge
Help
Hide
Inﬂuence
Magic
Ready
Search
Study
Utilize
Advantage
If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s,
and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by
more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Dis-
advantage on the same roll cancel each other. See
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Adventure
An adventure is a series of encounters. A
story emerges through playing them. See also
“Encounter.”
Alignment
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two actors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors al-
low for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful
Good and Neutral Evil. See also “Character Creation”
(“Create Your Character”).
Ally
A creature is your ally if it is a member of your ad-
venturing party, your friend, on your side in combat,
or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as
your ally.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
177
Area of Effect
The descriptions of many spells and other features
specify that they have an area of effect, which typ-
ically has one of six shapes. These shapes are de-
fined elsewhere in this glossary:
Cone
Cube
Cylinder
Emanation
Line
Sphere
An area of effect has a point of origin, a location
from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for
each shape specify how to position its point of ori-
gin. If all straight lines extending from the point of
origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked,
that location isn’t included in the area of effect.
To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total
Cover. See also “Cover.”
If the creator of an area of effect places it at an
unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—
is between the creator and that point, the point
of origin comes into being on the near side of the
obstruction.
Armor Class
An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an
attack roll. AC represents how dificult it is to hit a
target.
Your base AC calculation is 0 plus your Dexterity
modifier. Ia rule gives you another base AC calcula-
tion, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t
use more than one. See also “Attack Roll.”
Armor Training
Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain
category without the following drawbacks. If you
wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack train-
ing with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test
that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t
cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with
it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. See also “Disadvan-
tage” and “Equipment” (“Armor”).
Attack [Action]
When you take the Attack action, you can make one
attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Equipping and Unequipping Weapons. You can
either equip or unequip one weapon when you make
an attack as part of this action. You do so either
before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon
before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that at-
tack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from
a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon in-
cludes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.
Moving between Attacks. If you move on your
turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that
gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack
action, you can use some or all of that movement to
move between those attacks.
Attack Roll
An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making
an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a
spell. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Attitude
A monster has a starting attitude toward a player
character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. See also
“Friendly,” “Hostile,” “Indierent,” and “Influence.”
Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them beore the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. A
creature can have Attunement with no more than
three magic items at a time. See also “Equipment”
(“Magic Items”).
Blinded [Condition]
While you have the Blinded condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Can’t See. You can’t see and automatically fail any
ability check that requires sight.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
Blindsight
Iyou have Blindsight, you can see within a specific
range without relying on physical sight. Within that
range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total
Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are
in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see
something that has the Invisible condition.
Bloodied
A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points
or fewer remaining.
Bonus Action
A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take
on the same turn that you take an action. You can’t
take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you
have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly
says so. See also “Playing the Game” (“Actions”).
Breaking Objects
Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some
spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceed-
ingly fragile, the GM may allow a creature to break
it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.
Armor Class. The Object Armor Class table sug-
gests ACs for various substances.

Hit Points. An object is destroyed when it has 0
Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit
Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large
or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargan-
tuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections,
and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The
GM determines whether destroying part of an ob-
ject causes the whole thing to collapse.

Damage Types and Objects. Objects have Immu-
nity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might
decide that some damage types are more or less ef-
fective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning
damage works well for smashing things but not for
cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnera-
bility to Fire damage.
Damage Threshold. Big objects, such as castle
walls, often have extra resilience represented by a
damage threshold. See also “Damage Threshold.”
No Ability Scores. An object lacks ability scores
unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without
ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks,
and it fails all saving throws.
Bright Light
Bright Light is normal illumination. See also “Play-
ing the Game” (“Exploration”).
Burning [Hazard]
A burning creature or object takes d4 Fire damage
at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you
can extinguish fire on yourselby giving yoursel
the Prone condition and rolling on the ground.
The fire also goes out iit is doused, submerged, or
suffocated.
Burrow Speed
A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The
creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless the
creature has a trait that allows it to do so. See also
“Speed.”
Campaign
A campaign is a series of adventures. See also
“Adventure.”
Cantrip
A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a
spell slot. See also “Spells.”
Carrying Capacity
Your size and Strength score determine the maxi-
mum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown
in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows
the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push.
While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in ex-
cess of the maximum weight you can carry, your
Speed can be no more than 5 feet.

Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a
monster poses to a group of four player characters.
Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If
the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the
CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat.
But circumstances and the number of player charac-
ters can significantly alter how threatening a mon-
ster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat
Encounters”) provides guidance to the GM on using
CR while planning potential combat encounters. See
also “Stat Block.”
Character Sheet
A character sheet is a paper or digital record that
you use to track your character’s information. See
also “Character Creation.”
Charmed [Condition]
While you have the Charmed condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Can’t Harm the Charmer. You can’t attack the
charmer or target the charmer with damaging abili-
ties or magical effects.
Social Advantage. The charmer has Advantage on
any ability check to interact with you socially.
Climbing
While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs
1 extra oot (2 extra eet in Dificult Terrain). You
ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and
use it to climb.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
179
At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or
one with few handholds might require a successful
DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check.
Climb Speed
A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to tra-
verse a vertical surface without expending the extra
movement normally associated with climbing. See
also “Climbing” and “Speed.”
Concentration
Some spells and other effects require Concentration
to remain active, as specified in their descriptions.
If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect
ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the ef-
ect’s description specifies how long the creator can
concentrate on it: up to minute, hour, or some
other duration. The creator can end Concentration
at any time (no action required). The following fac-
tors break Concentration.
Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concen-
tration on an effect the moment you start casting
a spell that requires Concentration or activate an-
other effect that requires Concentration.
Damage. If you take damage, you must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concen-
tration. The DC equals 0 or half the damage taken
(round down), whichever number is higher, up to a
maximum DC of 30.
Incapacitated or Dead. Your Concentration ends
if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.
Condition
A condition is a temporary game state. The defini-
tion of a condition says how it affects its recipient,
and various rules define how to end a condition.
This glossary defines these conditions:
Blinded
Charmed
Deafened
Exhaustion
Frightened
Grappled
Incapacitated
Invisible
Paralyzed
Petriﬁed
Poisoned
Prone
Restrained
Stunned
Unconscious
A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient
either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion
condition is an exception to that rule.
Cone [Area of Effect]
A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator
chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of
origin. For example, a Cone is 5 feet wide at a point
along its length that is 5 feet from the point of
origin. The eect that creates a Cone specifies its
maximum length.
A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
Cover
Cover provides a degree of protection to a target
behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of
which provides a dierent benefit to a target: Hal
Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws),
Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexter-
ity saving throws), and Total Cover (can’t be tar-
geted directly). If behind more than one degree of
cover, a target benefits only rom the most protec-
tive degree. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Crawling
While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs
1 extra oot (2 extra eet in Dificult Terrain). See
also “Speed.”
Creature
Any being in the game, including a player’s charac-
ter, is a creature. See also “Creature Type.”
Creature Type
Every creature, including every player character,
has a tag in the rules that identifies the type ocrea-
ture it is. Most player characters are of the Human-
oid type. These are the game’s creature types:
Aberration
Beast
Celestial
Construct
Dragon
Elemental
Fey
Fiend
Giant
Humanoid
Monstrosity
Ooze
Plant
Undead
The types don’t have rules themselves, but some
rules in the game affect creatures of certain types
in different ways.
Critical Hit
If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you
score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC. A Critical Hit lets
you roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against
the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice
and add them together. Then add any relevant mod-
ifiers. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and
Healing”).
Cube [Area of Effect]
A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a
face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube spec-
ifies its size, which is the length oeach side.
A Cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
Curses
Some game effects curse a creature or an object.
The eect that coners a curse defines what the
curse does. Curses can be removed by the Remove
Curse and Greater Restoration spells or other magic
that explicitly ends curses.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
180
Cylinder [Area of Effect]
A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a point of origin located at the
center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder.
The eect that creates a Cylinder specifies the ra-
dius of the Cylinder’s base and the Cylinder’s height.
A Cylinder’s point of origin is included in the area
of effect.
D20 Test
D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of
the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws. If something in the game affects D20 Tests,
it affects all three of these rolls. The GM determines
whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circum-
stance. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Damage
Damage represents harm that causes a creature or
an object to lose Hit Points.
Damage Roll
A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applica-
ble modifiers, that deals damage to a target. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Damage Threshold
A creature or an object that has a damage thresh-
old has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an
amount of damage from a single attack or effect
equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in
which case it takes that entire instance of dam-
age. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the
damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce
Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage
threshold of 0, the object takes no damage if 9
damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to
exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 
damage, it takes all of that damage.
Damage Types
Attacks and other harmful effects deal different
types of damage. Damage types have no rules of
their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely
on the types. The Damage Types table offers exam-
ples to help a GM assign a type to a new effect.
Damage Types

Darkvision
If you have Darkvision, you can see in Dim Light
within a specified range as iit were Bright Light
and in Darkness within that range as if it were
Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness
only as shades of gray. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).
Dash [Action]
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra
movement for the current turn. The increase equals
your Speed ater applying any modifiers. With a
Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to
60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30
feet is reduced to 5 feet, you can move up to 30 feet
this turn if you Dash.
If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or
Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your
Speed when you take this action. You choose which
speed to use each time you take it. See also “Speed.”
Dead
A dead creature has no Hit Points and can’t regain
them unless it is first revived by magic such as the
Raise Dead or Revivify spell. When such a spell is
cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can re-
fuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body
and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the
creature requires calling the spirit back.
If the creature returns to life, the revival effect
determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Un-
less otherwise stated, the creature returns to life
with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses
that were affecting it at death if the durations of
those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died
with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with fewer
level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more
magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.

Deafened [Condition]
While you have the Deafened condition, you experi-
ence the following effect.
Can’t Hear. You can’t hear and automatically fail
any ability check that requires hearing.
Death Saving Throw
A player character must make a Death Saving
Throw (also called a Death Save) if they start their
turn with 0 Hit Points. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Damage and Healing”).
Dehydration [Hazard]
A creature requires an amount of water per day
based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per
Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the
required water for a day gains Exhaustion level
at the day’s end. Exhaustion caused by dehydra-
tion can’t be removed until the creature drinks the
full amount of water required for a day. See also
“Exhaustion.”

Difﬁcult Terrain
Ia space is Dificult Terrain, every oot omove-
ment in that space costs extra foot. For example,
moving 5 eet through Dificult Terrain costs 10 eet
omovement. Dificult Terrain isn’t cumulative; ei-
ther a space is Dificult Terrain or it isn’t.
A space is Dificult Terrain ithe space contains
any of the following or something similar:
• A creature that isn’t Tiny or your ally
• Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or
larger
• Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth
• Liquid that’s between shin- and waist-deep
• A narrow opening sized for a creature one size
smaller than you
• A slope of 20 degrees or more
Difﬁculty Class
A Dificulty Class (DC) is the target number or an
ability check or a saving throw. See also “Playing the
Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Dim Light
An area with Dim Light is Lightly Obscured. See
also “Lightly Obscured” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).
Disadvantage
If you have Disadvantage on a D20 Test, roll two
d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can’t be affected
by more than one Disadvantage, and Advantage and
Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. See
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Disengage [Action]
If you take the Disengage action, your movement
doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of
the current turn.
Dodge [Action]
If you take the Dodge action, you gain the following
benefits: until the start oyour next turn, any attack
roll made against you has Disadvantage if you can
see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving
throws with Advantage.
You lose these benefits iyou have the Incapaci-
tated condition or if your Speed is 0.
Emanation [Area of Effect]
An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a creature or an object in all di-
rections. The effect that creates an Emanation spec-
ifies the distance it extends.
An Emanation moves with the creature or object
that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a
stationary effect.
An Emanation’s origin (creature or object) isn’t
included in the area of effect unless its creator de-
cides otherwise.
Encounter
An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part
of at least one of the game’s three pillars: social in-
teraction, exploration, or combat. See also “Playing
the Game” (“Social Interaction,” “Exploration,” and
“Combat”).
Enemy
A creature is your enemy iit fights against you in
combat, actively works to harm you, or is desig-
nated as your enemy by the rules or GM.
Exhaustion [Condition]
While you have the Exhaustion condition, you
experience the following effects.
Exhaustion Levels. This condition is cumulative.
Each time you receive it, you gain Exhaustion
level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
D20 Tests Affected. When you make a D20 Test,
the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
Speed Reduced. Your Speed is reduced by a num-
ber of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
Removing Exhaustion Levels. Finishing a Long
Rest removes of your Exhaustion levels. When
your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Experience Points
As they overcome challenges and complete ad-
ventures, characters earn Experience Points (XP),
which are awarded by the Game Master. When a
character’s XP total crosses certain thresholds,
the character’s level increases. See also “Level
Advancement.”
Expertise
Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a
skill proficiency. When you make an ability check
with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise,
your Proficiency Bonus is doubled or that check un-
less the bonus is doubled by another feature.
If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in
which you have proficiency. You can’t have Exper-
tise in the same skill proficiency more than once.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).
Falling [Hazard]
A creature that falls takes d6 Bludgeoning dam-
age at the end of the fall for every 0 feet it fell, to
a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it
has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any
damage from the fall.
A creature that falls into water or another liquid
can use its Reaction to make a DC 5 Strength (Ath-
letics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the
surace head or eet first. On a successul check, any
damage resulting from the fall is halved.
Flying
A variety oeects allow a creature to fly. While fly-
ing, you fall if you have the Incapacitated or Prone
condition or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can
stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.
See also “Falling” and “Fly Speed.”
Fly Speed
A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air.
While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until
you land, fall, or die. See also “Flying” and “Speed.”
Friendly [Attitude]
A Friendly creature views you favorably. You
have Advantage on an ability check to influence a
Friendly creature. See also “Influence.”
Frightened [Condition]
While you have the Frightened condition, you expe-
rience the following effects.
Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have
Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls
while the source of fear is within line of sight.
Can’t Approach. You can’t willingly move closer to
the source of fear.
Grappled [Condition]
While you have the Grappled condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on at-
tack rolls against any target other than the grappler.
Movable. The grappler can drag or carry you
when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 
extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes
smaller than it.
Grappling
A creature can grapple another creature. Charac-
ters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike.
Many monsters have special attacks that allow
them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is
initiated, it follows these rules. See also “Unarmed
Strike” and “Grappled.”
Grappled Condition. Successfully grappling a
creature gives it the Grappled condition.
One Grapple per Hand. A creature must have a
hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat
blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple
using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. What-
ever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one
creature at a time with that part, and the grappler
can’t use that part to target another creature unless
it ends the grapple.
Ending a Grapple. A Grappled creature can use
its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexter-
ity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple’s escape
DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The
condition also ends if the grappler has the Inca-
pacitated condition or if the distance between the
Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grap-
ple’s range. In addition, the grappler can release the
target at any time (no action required).
Hazard
A hazard is an environmental danger. See also
“Burning,” “Dehydration,” “Falling,” “Malnutrition,”
and “Suffocation.”
Healing
Healing is how you regain Hit Points. See also “Play-
ing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Heavily Obscured
You have the Blinded condition while trying to see
something in a Heavily Obscured space. See also
“Blinded,” “Darkness,” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).
Help [Action]
When you take the Help action, you do one of the
following.
Assist an Ability Check. Choose one of your
skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near

System Reference Document 5.2.1
183
enough for you to assist verbally or physically when
they make an ability check. That ally has Advantage
on the next ability check they make with the chosen
skill or tool. This benefit expires ithe ally doesn’t
use it before the start of your next turn. The GM has
final say on whether your assistance is possible.
Assist an Attack Roll. You momentarily distract
an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to
the next attack roll by one of your allies against that
enemy. This benefit expires at the start oyour next
turn.
Heroic Inspiration
If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration,
you can expend it to reroll any die immediately af-
ter rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
If you gain Heroic Inspiration but already have it,
it’s lost unless you give it to a player character who
lacks it.
Hide [Action]
With the Hide action, you try to hide yourself. To do
so, you must succeed on a DC 5 Dexterity (Stealth)
check while you’re Heavily Obscured or behind
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must
be out of any enemy’s line of sight; if you can see a
creature, you can discern whether it can see you.
On a successful check, you have the Invisible con-
dition while hidden. Make note of your check’s total,
which is the DC or a creature to find you with a
Wisdom (Perception) check.
You stop being hidden immediately after any of
the following occurs: you make a sound louder than
a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack
roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.
High Jump
When you make a High Jump, you leap into the
air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength
modifier (minimum o0 eet) iyou move at least
0 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only
half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump
costs a foot of movement.
You can extend your arms half your height above
yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a dis-
tance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 times
your height.
Hit Point Dice
Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine
a player character’s Hit Point maximum, as ex-
plained in “Character Creation.” Most monsters also
have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during
a Short Rest to regain Hit Points. See also “Short
Rest.”
Hit Points
Hit Points (HP) are a measure ohow dificult it is
to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage
reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them.
You can’t have more Hit Points than your Hit Point
maximum, and you can’t have less than 0. See also
“Breaking Objects” and “Playing the Game” (“Dam-
age and Healing”).
Hostile [Attitude]
A Hostile creature views you unfavorably. You have
Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hos-
tile creature. See also “Influence.”
Hover
Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat
blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the
ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents
you from falling in certain circumstances. See also
“Flying.”
Illusions
Spells and other effects sometimes create magical il-
lusions. Such an eect defines what the illusion does
and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.
If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is
insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be
affected by the environment as if the illusion were
real unless the eect that created it specifies oth-
erwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature
casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears
to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible
illusion echoes in an echoey space.
Immunity
If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condi-
tion, it doesn’t affect you in any way.
Improvised Weapons
An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a
makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg,
or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also
counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in
a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged
weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Me-
lee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the
weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An impro-
vised weapon follows the rules below.
Proficiency. Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to
attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
Damage. On a hit, the weapon deals d4 damage
of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object.
Range. If you throw the weapon, it has a normal
range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Weapon Equivalents. If an improvised weapon
resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may
say it functions as that weapon and uses that weap-
on’s rules. For example, the GM could treat a table
leg as a Club.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Incapacitated [Condition]
While you have the Incapacitated condition, you ex-
perience the following effects.
Inactive. You can’t take any action, Bonus Action,
or Reaction.
No Concentration. Your Concentration is broken.
Speechless. You can’t speak.
Surprised. If you’re Incapacitated when you roll
Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.
Indifferent [Attitude]
An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hin-
der you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a mon-
ster. See also “Influence.”
Inﬂuence [Action]
With the Influence action, you urge a monster to
do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re
communicating with the monster. Are you trying to
deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The
GM then determines whether the monster feels will-
ing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction;
this determination establishes whether an ability
check is necessary, as explained below.
Willing. If your urging aligns with the monster’s
desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster
ulfills your request in a way it preers.
Unwilling. If your urging is repugnant to the mon-
ster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is
necessary; it doesn’t comply.
Hesitant. If you urge the monster to do something
that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability
check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude:
Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is
defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks ta-
ble suggests which ability check to make based on
how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM
chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to
5 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever
is higher. On a successful check, the monster does
as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours
(or a duration set by the GM) before urging it in the
same way again.

Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during com-
bat. The combat rules in “Playing the Game” explain
how to roll Initiative.
Sometimes a GM might have combatants use
their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative.
Your Initiative score equals 0 plus your Dexterity
modifier. Iyou have Advantage on Initiative rolls,
increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have Dis-
advantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Invisible [Condition]
While you have the Invisible condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Surprise. If you’re Invisible when you roll Initia-
tive, you have Advantage on the roll.
Concealed. You aren’t affected by any effect that
requires its target to be seen unless the effect’s cre-
ator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are
wearing or carrying is also concealed.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advan-
tage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t
gain this benefit against that creature.
Jumping
When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (hor-
izontal) or a High Jump (vertical). See also “Long
Jump” and “High Jump.”
Knocking Out a Creature
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the
creature to Hit Point. The creature then has the
Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest.
The creature remains Unconscious until it regains
any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to
administer first aid to it, which requires a success-
ful DC 0 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Lightly Obscured
You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured
space. See also “Dim Light” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).
Line [Area of Effect]
A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point
of origin in a straight path along its length and cov-
ers an area defined by its width. The eect that cre-
ates a Line specifies its length and width.
A Line’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of
effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
Long Jump
When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally
a number of feet up to your Strength score if you

System Reference Document 5.2.1
185
move at least 0 feet immediately before the jump.
When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap
only half that distance. Either way, each foot you
jump costs a foot of movement.
Iyou land in Dificult Terrain, you must succeed
on a DC 0 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the
Prone condition.
This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of
the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a
stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must suc-
ceed on a DC 0 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a
low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s
distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise,
you hit the obstacle.
Long Rest
A Long Rest is a period oextended downtime—at
least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a
Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and per-
form no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition.
Ater you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least
6 hours before starting another one.
Benefits othe Rest. To start a Long Rest, you
must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the
rest, you gain the ollowing benefits:
Regain All HP. You regain all lost Hit Points and all
spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum
was reduced, it returns to normal.
Ability Scores Restored. If any of your ability
scores were reduced, they return to normal.
Exhaustion Reduced. If you have the Exhaustion
condition, its level decreases by .
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.
Interrupting the Rest. A Long Rest is stopped by
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a cantrip
• Taking any damage
• hour of walking or other physical exertion
If you rested at least hour before the interruption,
you gain the benefits oa Short Rest. See also “Short
Rest.”
You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an
interruption. If you do so, the rest requires addi-
tional hour per interruption to finish.
Magic [Action]
When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell
that has a casting time of an action or use a feature
or magic item that requires a Magic action to be
activated.
If you cast a spell that has a casting time of min-
ute or longer, you must take the Magic action on
each turn of that casting, and you must maintain
Concentration while you do so. If your Concentra-
tion is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a
spell slot. See also “Concentration.”
Magical Effect
An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic
item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.
Malnutrition [Hazard]
A creature needs an amount of food per day based
on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day ta-
ble. A creature that eats but consumes less than half
the required food for a day must succeed on a DC
0 Constitution saving throw or gain Exhaustion
level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing
for 5 days automatically gains Exhaustion level at
the end othe fith day as well as an additional level
at the end of each subsequent day without food.
Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can’t be re-
moved until the creature eats the full amount of
food required for a day. See also “Exhaustion.”

Monster
A monster is a creature controlled by the GM, even
if the creature is benevolent. See also “Creature” and
“NPC.”
Nonplayer Character
A nonplayer character (NPC) is a monster that has
a personal name and a distinct personality. See also
“Monster.”
Object
An object is a nonliving, distinct thing. Composite
things, like buildings, comprise more than one ob-
ject. See also “Breaking Objects.”
Occupied Space
A space is occupied if a creature is in it or if it is
completely filled by objects.
Opportunity Attacks
You can make an Opportunity Attack when a crea-
ture that you can see leaves your reach using its
action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its
speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Re-
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against the provoking creature.
The attack occurs right before the creature leaves
your reach. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Paralyzed [Condition]
While you have the Paralyzed condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of
you.
Passive Perception
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a crea-
ture’s general awareness of its surroundings. The
GM uses this score when determining whether a
creature notices something without consciously
making a Wisdom (Perception) check.
A creature’s Passive Perception equals 0 plus the
creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the
creature has Advantage on such checks, increase
the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on
them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level
1 character with a Wisdom o15 and proficiency in
Perception has a Passive Perception of 4 (0 + 2 +
2). If that character has Advantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks, the score becomes 9.
Per Day
If a rule says you can use something a certain num-
ber otimes per day, that means you must finish a
Long Rest to use it again after you run out of uses.
Petriﬁed [Condition]
While you have the Petrified condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Turned to Inanimate Substance. You are trans-
formed, along with any nonmagical objects you are
wearing and carrying, into a solid inanimate sub-
stance (usually stone). Your weight increases by a
factor of ten, and you cease aging.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Resist Damage. You have Resistance to all
damage.
Poison Immunity. You have Immunity to the Poi-
soned condition.
Player Character
A player character is a character controlled by a
player. See also “Character Creation.”
Poisoned [Condition]
While you have the Poisoned condition, you experi-
ence the following effect.
Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have
Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Possession
Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by
another creature or entity. A possessing effect de-
fines how the possession operates. Possession can
be prevented by the Protection from Evil and Good
spell and ended by the Dispel Evil and Good spell.
Proﬁciency
Iyou have proficiency with something, you can add
your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make
using that thing. A creature might have proficiency
in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).
Prone [Condition]
While you have the Prone condition, you experience
the following effects.
Restricted Movement. Your only movement op-
tions are to crawl or to spend an amount of move-
ment equal to half your Speed (round down) to
right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your
Speed is 0, you can’t right yourself.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on at-
tack rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage
if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise,
that attack roll has Disadvantage.
Reach
A creature has a reach of 5 feet unless a rule says
otherwise.
Reaction
A Reaction is a special action taken in response to
a trigger defined in the Reaction’s description. You
can take a Reaction on another creature’s turn, and
if you take it on your turn, you can do so even if you
also take an action, a Bonus Action, or both. Once
you take a Reaction, you can’t take another one
until the start of your next turn. The Opportunity
Attack is a Reaction available to all creatures. See
also “Opportunity Attacks” and “Playing the Game”
(“Actions”).
Ready [Action]
You take the Ready action to wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this
action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a
Reaction before the start of your next turn.
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the
action you will take in response to that trigger, or
you choose to move up to your Speed in response
to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the

System Reference Document 5.2.1
187
trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the
zombie steps next to me, I move away.”
When the trigger occurs, you can either take your
Reaction right ater the trigger finishes or ignore
the trigger.
When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (ex-
pending any resources used to cast it) but hold its
energy, which you release with your Reaction when
the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have
a casting time of an action, and holding on to the
spell’s magic requires Concentration, which you can
maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your
Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates with-
out taking effect.
Resistance
If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage
of that type is halved against you (round down).
Resistance is applied only once to an instance of
damage. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and
Healing”).
Restrained [Condition]
While you have the Restrained condition, you expe-
rience the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You have Disadvantage
on Dexterity saving throws.
Ritual
If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag,
you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual ver-
sion of a spell takes 0 minutes longer to cast than
normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which
means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a
higher level. See also “Spells.”
Round Down
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction,
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some
rules make an exception and tell you to round up.
Save
Save is another name for a saving throw. See also
“Saving Throw.”
Saving Throw
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally
make a saving throw only when a rule requires you
to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without
rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect
that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save
and lacks the ability score used by it, the target au-
tomatically fails. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20
Tests”).
Search [Action]
When you take the Search action, you make a Wis-
dom check to discern something that isn’t obvious.
The Search table suggests which skills are applica-
ble when you take this action, depending on what
you’re trying to detect.
Search
Skill
Thing to Detect
Insight
Creature’s state of mind
Medicine
Creature’s ailment or cause of death
Perception
Concealed creature or object
Survival
Tracks or food
Shape-Shifting
If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the Polymorph
spell, lets you shape-shit, its description specifies
what happens to you. Unless that description says
otherwise, any ongoing eects on you—conditions,
spells, curses, and the like—carry over rom one
form to the other. You revert to your true form if
you die.
Short Rest
A Short Rest is a -hour period of downtime, during
which a creature does nothing more strenuous than
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start
a Short Rest, you must have at least Hit Point.
Benefits othe Rest. When you finish the rest, you
gain the ollowing benefits:
Spend Hit Point Dice. You can spend one or more
of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For
each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the
die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You
regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 
Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional
Hit Point Die after each roll.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.
Interrupting the Rest. A Short Rest is stopped by
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a cantrip
• Taking any damage
An interrupted Short Rest coners no benefits.
Simultaneous Effects
If two or more things happen at the same time on a
turn, the person at the game table—player or GM—
whose turn it is decides the order in which those
things happen. For example, if two effects occur at
the start of a player character’s turn, the player de-
cides which othe eects happens first.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Size
A creature or an object belongs to a size category:
Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.
A creature’s size determines how much space the
creature occupies in combat. An object’s size affects
its Hit Points. See also “Breaking Objects” and “Play-
ing the Game” (“Combat”).
Skill
A skill is an area of specialization associated with
an ability check. Iyou have proficiency in a skill,
you can add your Proficiency Bonus when you make
an ability check associated with that skill. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).
Speed
A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet
the creature can cover when it moves on its turn.
See also “Climbing,” “Crawling,” “Flying,” “Jumping,”
“Swimming” and “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Special Speeds. Some creatures have special
speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly
Speed, or Swim Speed, each owhich is defined
in this glossary. If you have more than one speed,
choose which one to use when you move; you can
switch between the speeds during your move.
Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already
moved from the new speed. The result determines
how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or
less, you can’t use the new speed during the current
move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a
Fly Speed o40, you could fly 10 eet, walk 10 eet,
and leap into the air to fly 20 eet more.
Changes to Your Speeds. If an effect increases or
decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed
you have increases or decreases by an equal amount
for the same duration. For example, if your Speed
is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your
Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your
Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly
Speed is also halved.
Spell
A spell is a magical effect that has the characteris-
tics described in “Spells.”
Spell Attack
A spell attack is an attack roll made as part of a spell
or another magical effect. See also “Spells” (“Casting
Spells”).
Spellcasting Focus
A Spellcasting Focus is an object that certain crea-
tures can use in place of a spell’s Material compo-
nents if those materials aren’t consumed by the
spell and don’t have a cost specified. Some classes
allow its members to use certain types of Spellcast-
ing Focuses. See also “Spells” (“Casting Spells”).
Sphere [Area of Effect]
A Sphere is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin outward in all direc-
tions. The eect that creates a Sphere specifies the
distance it extends as the radius of the Sphere.
A Sphere’s point of origin is included in the
Sphere’s area of effect.
Stable
A creature is Stable if it has 0 Hit Points but isn’t
required to make Death Saving Throws. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Stat Block
A stat block contains the game statistics of a mon-
ster. Each stat block includes the following informa-
tion presented after the monster’s name.
Size. A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large,
Huge, or Gargantuan. See also “Size.”
Creature Type. This entry notes the family of be-
ings a monster belongs to, along with any descrip-
tive tags. See also “Creature Type.”
Alignment. An alignment is suggested for the
monster, with the GM determining its actual align-
ment. See also “Alignment.”
AC, Initiative, and HP. These entries give the
monster’s Armor Class, Initiative, and Hit Points,
which are detailed in “Playing the Game.” In paren-
theses after the Hit Points, the monster’s Hit Point
Dice are provided, along with the contribution of its
Constitution, if any, to its Hit Points. Following the
Initiative modifier is an Initiative score. Some crea-
tures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and
Initiative information.
Speed. Here the monster’s Speed is provided,
along with any special speeds. See also “Burrow
Speed,” “Climb Speed,” “Fly Speed,” and “Swim
Speed.”
Ability Scores. A table provides the monster’s
ability scores, modifiers, and saving throw modifi-
ers, all of which are detailed in “Playing the Game.”
Skills. This entry lists the monster’s skill pro-
ficiencies, iany. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Proficiency”).
Resistances and Vulnerabilities. These entries
list the monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if
any. See also “Resistance” and “Vulnerability.”
Immunities. This section lists the monster’s
damage and condition Immunities, if any. See also
“Immunity.”
Gear. If the monster has any equipment that can
be given away or retrieved, it’s listed in this entry.
Senses. This entry lists the monster’s special
senses, such as Darkvision, and its Passive Percep-
tion. See also “Passive Perception.”
Languages. This entry lists any languages the
monster knows.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
189
CR. Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a
monster poses and is detailed in “Monsters.” The
Experience Points characters receive for defeating
a monster and its Proficiency Bonus ollow. Some
creatures that are created by magic have no CR. See
also “Challenge Rating” and “Experience Points.”
Traits. The monster’s traits, if any, are features
that are active at all times or in certain situations.
Actions. The monster can take these actions in
addition to those detailed in this glossary. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Actions”).
Bonus Actions. If the monster has Bonus Action
options, they are listed in this section.
Reactions. If the monster can take special Reac-
tions, those are listed in this section.
Attack Notation. The entry for a monster’s attack
starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee
or a ranged attack and then provides the attack
roll’s bonus, its reach or range, and what happens
on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its
entry says otherwise.
Saving Throw Effect Notation. If an effect forces
a saving throw, the effect’s entry starts by identify-
ing the kind of saving throw required and then pro-
vides the save’s DC, a description of which creatures
must make the save, and what happens on a failed
or a successful save.
Damage Notation. A stat block usually provides
both a static number and a die expression for each
instance of damage. For example, an attack might
deal 4 (d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The GM deter-
mines whether you use the static number or the die
expression in parentheses; you don’t use both.
Study [Action]
When you take the Study action, you make an Intel-
ligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue,
or another source of knowledge and call to mind an
important piece of information about it.
The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which
skills are applicable to various areas of knowledge.
Areas of Knowledge
Skill
Areas
Arcana
Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols,
magical traditions, planes of existence,
and certain creatures (Aberrations,
Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and
Monstrosities)
History
Historic events and people, ancient
civilizations, wars, and certain creatures
(Giants and Humanoids)
Investigation
Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry
Nature
Terrain, ﬂora, weather, and certain
creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and
Plants)
Religion
Deities, religious hierarchies and rites,
holy symbols, cults, and certain crea-
tures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead)
Stunned [Condition]
While you have the Stunned condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Suffocation [Hazard]
A creature can hold its breath for a number of
minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins.
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking,
it gains Exhaustion level at the end of each of
its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it
removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from
suffocating.
Surprise
If a creature is caught unawares by the start of
combat, that creature is surprised, which causes it
to have Disadvantage on its Initiative roll. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Swimming
While you’re swimming, each foot of movement
costs 1 extra oot (2 extra eet in Dificult Terrain).
You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed
and use it to swim. At the GM’s option, moving any
distance in rough water might require a successful
DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check.
Swim Speed
A Swim Speed can be used to swim without expend-
ing the extra movement normally associated with
swimming. See also “Swimming” and “Speed.”

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Target
A target is the creature or object targeted by an
attack roll, forced to make a saving throw by an
effect, or selected to receive the effects of a spell or
another phenomenon.
Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. Unless a rule states other-
wise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a
language with the telepath to understand this com-
munication, but the contacted creature must be able
to understand at least one language or be telepathic
itself to understand.
A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted crea-
ture, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic
contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic
contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken
if either the telepath or the other creature has the
Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also
broken if the contacted creature is no longer within
the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a
different creature within range.
A creature without telepathy can receive tele-
pathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic con-
versation. Once a telepathic conversation starts,
the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the
telepath until the telepathic connection ends.
Teleportation
Teleportation is a special kind of magical transpor-
tation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear
elsewhere instantly, without moving through the
intervening space. This transportation doesn’t ex-
pend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise,
and teleportation never provokes Opportunity
Attacks.
When you teleport, all the equipment you’re
wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re
touching another creature when you teleport, that
creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the tele-
portation effect says otherwise.
If the destination space of your teleportation is
occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid
obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccu-
pied space of your choice.
The description of a teleportation effect tells you
if you must see the teleportation’s destination.
Temporary Hit Points
Temporary Hit Points are granted by certain effects
and act as a buffer against losing real Hit Points. See
also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Tremorsense
A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the loca-
tion of creatures and moving objects within a spe-
cific range, provided that the creature with Trem-
orsense and anything it is detecting are both in
contact with the same surface (such as the ground,
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in
the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.
Truesight
If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced
within a specified range. Within that range, your
vision pierces through the following:
Darkness. You can see in normal and magical
Darkness.
Invisibility. You see creatures and objects that have
the Invisible condition.
Visual Illusions. Visual illusions appear transpar-
ent to you, and you automatically succeed on sav-
ing throws against them.
Transformations. You discern the true form of any
creature or object you see that has been trans-
formed by magic.
Ethereal Plane. You see into the Ethereal Plane.
Unarmed Strike
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack,
you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar
forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed
Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your
body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5
feet of you.
Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose
one of the following options for its effect.
Damage. You make an attack roll against the
target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength
modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the
target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to plus
your Strength modifier.
Grapple. The target must succeed on a Strength
or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it
has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving
throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your
Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grap-
ple is possible only if the target is no more than one
size larger than you and if you have a hand free to
grab it. See also “Grappling.”
Shove. The target must succeed on a Strength or
Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you ei-
ther push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone
condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus
your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This
shove is possible only if the target is no more than
one size larger than you.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
191
Unconscious [Condition]
While you have the Unconscious condition, you ex-
perience the following effects.
Inert. You have the Incapacitated and Prone
conditions, and you drop whatever you’re holding.
When this condition ends, you remain Prone.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of
you.
Unaware. You’re unaware of your surroundings.
Unoccupied Space
A space is unoccupied if no creatures are in it and it
isn’t completely filled by objects.
Utilize [Action]
You normally interact with an object while doing
something else, such as when you draw a sword as
part of the Attack action. When an object requires
an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.
Vulnerability
If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage
of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is
applied only once to an instance of damage. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Weapon
A weapon is an object that is in the Simple or
Martial weapon category. See also “Equipment”
(“Weapons”).
Weapon Attack
A weapon attack is an attack roll made with a
weapon. See also “Weapon.”

Gameplay Toolbox
Travel Pace
A group of characters can travel overland at a Nor-
mal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in “Playing the
Game.” During any journey stage, the predominant
terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel
pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the
Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a
group’s travel pace.
Good Roads
The presence of a good road increases the group’s
maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or
from Normal to Fast).
Slower Travelers
The group must move at a Slow pace if any group
member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.
Extended Travel
Characters can push themselves to travel for more
than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end
of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,
each character must succeed on a Constitution sav-
ing throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10
plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours.
Special Movement
If a party can travel at a high Speed for an extended
time, as with a spell such as Wind Walk or a magic
item such as a Carpet of Flying, translate the party’s
Speed into travel rates using these rules:
Miles per hour = Speed ÷ 10
Miles per day (Normal pace) = Miles per hour
× number of hours traveled (typically 8)
Fast pace = Miles per day × 1⅓(round down)
Slow pace = Miles per day × 2/3 (round down)
Ithe characters are flying or their special move-
ment allows them to ignore Dificult Terrain, they
can move at a Fast pace regardless of the terrain.
Vehicles
Characters traveling in a vehicle use the vehicle’s
speed in miles per hour (as shown in “Equipment”)
to determine their rate of travel, and they don’t
choose a travel pace.
Creating a Background
A character’s background represents what the char-
acter did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating
a unique background or customizing an existing
one can reflect the particular theme oyour cam-
paign or elements of your world. You can also create
a background to help a player craft the story they
have in mind for their character.
This section describes, step by step, how you can
create backgrounds tailored for your world and the
heroes in it.
1: Choose Abilities
Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the
background:
Strength or Dexterity. These abilities are ideal for
a background involving physical exertion.
Constitution. This ability is ideal for a background
that involves endurance or long hours of activity.

Intelligence or Wisdom. One or both abilities are
ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or
spiritual matters.
Charisma. This ability is ideal for a background
that involves performance or social interaction.
2: Choose a Feat
Choose one feat from the Origin category. See “Ori-
gin Feats” for examples of Origin feats.
3: Choose Skill Proficiencies
Choose two skills appropriate for the background.
There needn’t be a relationship between the skill
proficiencies a background grants and the ability
scores it increases.
4: Choose a Tool Proficiency
Choose one tool used in the practice of the back-
ground or often associated with it.
5: Choose Equipment
Assemble a package of equipment worth 50 GP (in-
cluding unspent gold). Don’t include Martial weap-
ons or armor, as characters get them from their
class choices.
Curses and
Magical Contagions
A curse is a magical burden that lasts or a specified
time or until it is ended by some means. A magical
contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that
is contagious by definition.
The following sections discuss curses and magical
contagions in detail.
Curses
A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed
below.
Bestow Curse
The simplest curses are created by the Bestow Curse
spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can
be ended by the Remove Curse spell.
Bestow Curse provides useful benchmarks for
gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that
lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while
one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9
spell.
Cursed Creatures
Some monsters are associated with curses, whether
as part of their origins or due to their ability to
spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.
You decide how a spell like Remove Curse affects
a creature with accursed origins. For example, you
might decide that a mummy was created through a
curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by
casting Remove Curse on its corpse.
Cursed Magic Items
Cursed magic items are created deliberately or
originate as the result of supernatural events. Such
items are detailed in “Magic Items.”
Narrative Curses
A curse might manifest during an adventure when
a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernat-
ural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a
tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can
have any effects you design, or it might be a custom-
ized version of another type of curse discussed in
this section.
A creature affected by such a curse should know
why they’re being punished and be able to learn
how to end their curse, likely by symbolically
righting the wrong they committed. How a spell
like Remove Curse affects a curse that’s part of your
adventure is up to you—the spell might merely sup-
press the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless,
narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic
rooted in the lore of your campaign.
Environmental Curses
Some locations are so suffused with evil that any-
one who lingers there is burdened with a curse.
Demonic Possession is one example of an environ-
mental curse.
Demonic Possession. Demonic Possession arises
from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly
besets creatures that interact with demonic objects
or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic
spirits await victims.
A creature that becomes the target of Demonic
Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma sav-
ing throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic
entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1
on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of
the creature and determines the creature’s behav-
ior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed
creature’s later turns, the creature makes a DC 15
Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself
on a success.
Ater finishing a Long Rest, a creature with De-
monic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving
throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the
creature. A Dispel Evil and Good spell or any magic
that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
194
Magical Contagions
Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic
are credited with creating the first magical con-
tagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form
the basis of an adventure as characters search for a
cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.
Rest and Recuperation
If a creature infected with a magical contagion
spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no
activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the
creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
at the end of the recuperation period. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature has Advantage on saving
throws to fight othe magical contagion or the
next 24 hours.
Example Contagions
The following examples show how magical conta-
gions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw
DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these con-
tagions to suit your campaign.
Cackle Fever
Magical Contagion
Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes
tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids
only (gnomes are strangely immune). A crea-
ture suffers the following effects 1d4 days after
infection:
Fever. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which
lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.
Uncontrollable Laughter. While the creature has
the Exhaustion condition, the creature makes
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it
takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a
failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic
damage and has the Incapacitated condition as
it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the
effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it suc-
ceeds automatically.
Fighting the Contagion. At the end oeach Long
Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitu-
tion saving throw. After the creature succeeds on
three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and
the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.
Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid (other
than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot
Emanation originating from a creature infected
with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Consti-
tution saving throw or also become infected with
the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid
can’t catch the contagion from that particular in-
fected creature for the next 24 hours.
Sewer Plague
Magical Contagion
Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise
to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and
refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by
creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyu-
ghs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a
creature that carries the contagion or that comes
into contact with contaminated filth or oal must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be-
come infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers
the following effects 1d4 days after infection:
Fatigue. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level.
Weakness. While the creature has any Exhaustion
levels, it regains only half the normal number of
Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice.
Restlessness. While the creature has any Exhaus-
tion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores
lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaus-
tion level.
Fighting the Contagion. Daily at dawn, an in-
fected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Ex-
haustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a success-
ful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases
by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to
0, the contagion ends on the creature.
Sight Rot
Magical Contagion
Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted
by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the
contagion ends.
Fighting the Contagion. Magic such as a Heal or
Lesser Restoration spell ends the contagion immedi-
ately. A character who is proficient with an Herbal-
ism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical
ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the
eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the oint-
ment suppresses the contagion on that creature for
24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way
for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and
applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on
the creature.
Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid that
makes skin contact with a creature infected with
Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or also become infected with the con-
tagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t
catch the contagion from that particular infected
creature for the next 24 hours.

Deep Water
Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet
deep) presents additional challenges because of the
water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each
hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that
lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Consti-
tution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Extreme Cold
When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or
lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at
the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold
damage automatically succeed on the save.
Extreme Heat
When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or
higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and
without access to drinkable water must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 or the first
hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have
Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Re-
sistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically
succeed on the save.
Frigid Water
A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score
before suffering any ill effects. Each additional
minute spent in frigid water requires the creature
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance
or Immunity to Cold damage automatically suc-
ceed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally
adapted to living in ice-cold water.
Heavy Precipitation
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy
snowall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the
area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception)
checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
High Altitude
Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above
sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the
reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such
a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts
as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long
that creature can travel (see “Travel Pace”).
Creatures can become acclimated to a high alti-
tude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation.
Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations
above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such
environments.
Slippery Ice
Slippery ice is Dificult Terrain. A creature that
moves onto slippery ice or the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
Strong Wind
Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged at-
tack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open
flames and disperses og. A flying creature in a
strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm
that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks.
Thin Ice
Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds
per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight
on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice
in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall
through. Below the ice is frigid water (see “Frigid
Water” above).

Fear and Mental Stress
Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers
tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress
than common olk. Whereas a armer might flee in
terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are
made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures
and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of
even the most stalwart adventurer.
If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them
with your players at the start of the campaign.
Fear Effects
Whenever the characters encounter something that
is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened con-
dition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically
require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC
based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample
Fear DCs table provides some examples.
Sample Fear DCs
Example
Save DC
When the characters open a sarcophagus, a
harmless yet terrifying apparition appears.
10
A character triggers a magical trap that
creates an illusory manifestation of that
character’s worst fears, visible only to that
character.
15
A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a
nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.
20
Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success.
At your discretion, a Frightened creature might
be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened
condition lasts. Consider these examples:
• The Frightened creature must take the Dash ac-
tion on each of its turns and uses its movement to
get farther away from the source of its fear.
• Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have
Advantage.
•
The Frightened creature can do only one of the
following on each of its turns: move, take an ac-
tion, or take a Bonus Action.
Mental Stress Effects
When a character is subjected to an effect that
causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the
best way to emulate that effect.
The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a
few examples of such effects, with suggested saving
throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually
be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but
sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more
appropriate. On a successful save, a character might
take half as much damage instead of no damage, at
your discretion.
Sample Mental Stress Effects
Example

Prolonged Effects
Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged ef-
fects. Consider the following possibilities.
Short-Term Effects. The character has the Fright-
ened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition for 1d10
minutes. This condition might be accompanied by
alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects
can be suppressed with the Calm Emotions spell or
removed by the Lesser Restoration spell.
Long-Term Effects. The character has Disad-
vantage on some or all ability checks for 1d10 × 10
hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability
to exert a particular set of abilities. The character
might feel enervated and unable to exert much
Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of
others that Charisma checks are more dificult.
These effects can be suppressed with the Calm
Emotions spell or removed by the Lesser Restoration
spell.
Indefinite Eects. An indefinite eect is a long-
term effect (see above) that lasts until removed by a
Greater Restoration spell. It can be suppressed by a
Calm Emotions spell.

Poison
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are
a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures.
Poisons come in the following four types:
Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an
object and remains potent until it is touched or
washed off. A creature that touches contact poi-
son with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose
of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose
can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may de-
cide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such
as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or
dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.
Inhaled. Poisonous powders and gases take effect
when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing
the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its
effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective
against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal mem-
branes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
Injury. Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus
Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or
similar object. The poison remains potent until
delivered through a wound or washed off. A crea-
ture that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from
an object coated with the poison is exposed to its
effects.
Purchasing Poison
In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and
use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous
apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters
with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poi-
son easily. Other characters might have to make ex-
tensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire
the poison they seek.
Harvesting Poison
A character can attempt to harvest poison from a
venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapaci-
tated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after
which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence
(Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a success-
ful check, the character harvests enough poison
for a single dose, and no additional poison can be
harvested from that creature. On a failed check,
the character is unable to extract any poison. If the
character fails the check by 5 or more, the character
is subjected to the creature’s poison.
Sample Poisons
Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical
order. Each poison’s description includes the sug-
gested price for a single dose of the poison, its type
(contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a descrip-
tion of the poison’s debilitating effects.
Assassin’s Blood (150 GP)
Ingested Poison
A creature subjected to Assassin’s Blood makes a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Poison damage and has
the Poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
Burnt Othur Fumes (500 GP)
Inhaled Poison
A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the
save at the start of each of its turns. On each succes-
sive failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) Poison
damage. After three successful saves, the poison
ends.
Crawler Mucus (200 GP)
Contact Poison
A creature subjected to Crawler Mucus must suc-
ceed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The creature
also has the Paralyzed condition while Poisoned in
this way. The creature repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.
Essence of Ether (300 GP)
Inhaled Poison
A creature subjected to Essence of Ether must suc-
ceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 8 hours. The creature
also has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned
in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes dam-
age or if another creature takes an action to shake
it awake.
Malice (250 GP)
Inhaled Poison
A creature subjected to Malice must succeed on a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Poi-
soned condition for 1 hour. The creature also has
the Blinded condition while Poisoned in this way.
Midnight Tears (1,500 GP)
Ingested Poison
A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no
effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that

System Reference Document 5.2.1
198
ends the Poisoned condition neutralizes this poi-
son. If the poison hasn’t been neutralized before
midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) Poison damage on a
failed save or half as much damage on a successful
one.
Oil of Taggit (400 GP)
Contact Poison
A creature subjected to Oil of Taggit must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 24 hours. The creature also
has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned in
this way. It wakes up if it takes damage.
Pale Tincture (250 GP)
Ingested Poison
A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed
on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3
(1d6) Poison damage and have the Poisoned condi-
tion. The Poisoned creature repeats the save every
24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage on a failed
save. The damage the poison deals can’t be healed
by any means while the creature remains Poisoned.
After seven successful saves against the poison, the
creature is no longer Poisoned.
Purple Worm Poison (2,000 GP)
Injury Poison
A creature subjected to Purple Worm Poison makes
a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6)
Poison damage on a failed save or half as much dam-
age on a successful one.
Serpent Venom (200 GP)
Injury Poison
A creature subjected to Serpent Venom must suc-
ceed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking
10 (3d6) Poison damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one.

Injury Poison
A creature subjected to Spider’s Sting must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 1 hour. If the creature fails
the save by 5 or more, the creature also has the Un-
conscious condition while Poisoned in this way. The
creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another
creature takes an action to shake it awake.
Torpor (600 GP)
Ingested Poison
A creature subjected to Torpor poison must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 4d6 hours. The creature’s
Speed is halved while the creature is Poisoned in
this way.

Traps
Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their
charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too
many traps in an adventure can lead players to be-
come overly cautious, which slows down the game.
The best traps are fleeting distractions that
skilled characters can overcome in a short amount
of time or deadly puzzles that require quick think-
ing and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are un-
detectable and inescapable are rarely fun.
Parts of a Trap
The description of a trap includes the following
parts after the trap’s name:
Severity and Levels. A trap is designated as a nui-
sance or as deadly for characters of certain levels.
A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm char-
acters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly
trap can grievously damage characters of the indi-
cated levels.
Trigger. Traps are often set to go off when a crea-
ture enters an area or touches an object. Examples
of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate,
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using
the wrong key in a lock.
Duration. Some traps have durations expressed
in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that
their effects last until the trap is destroyed or
dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its
effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after
activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is
otherwise inert after activation.
Use caution when introducing a trap to characters
of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap
that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly
to characters of a lower level range.
Example Traps
Traps are presented in alphabetical order.
Collapsing Roof
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration: Instantaneous
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable
section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the
ground and stretches between two weak supports
that topple when the trip wire is pulled.
The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the supports to topple and the unstable sec-
tion of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the
unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeon-
ing damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns
the trapped area into Dificult Terrain.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful
check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut
or avoided (no ability check required).
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as
shown in the following table.
Levels
Bludgeoning Damage
Save DC
5–10
22 (4d10)
15
11–16
55 (10d10)
17
17–20
99 (18d10)
19
Falling Net
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration: Instantaneous
A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a
weighted, 10-foot-square Net suspended from the
ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and
stretches between two columns or trees.
The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the Net to fall on it. The target must suc-
ceed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the
Restrained condition until it escapes. The target
succeeds automatically if it’s Huge or larger. A crea-
ture can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature
within its reach from the Net on a successful check.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once
detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided
(no ability check required).
Destroy the Net. Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points
frees any creature trapped in it (see “Adventuring
Gear” for the Net’s statistics).
Set the Trap. A creature that has Thieves’ Tools
and all the trap’s components (including a Net) can
try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a success-
ful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each
attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which
increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength
(Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC
14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20.
Fire-Casting Statue
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate

System Reference Document 5.2.1
200
Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the
start of the next turn
When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate or the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of
magical flame. The statue can look like anything,
such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the
Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Detect and Disarm. A Detect Magic spell reveals
an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a
Search action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue
can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a
successful check. Once the glyph is found, a charac-
ter can take a Study action to examine it and make a
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that
the glyph means “fire” on a successul check. As an
action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the
glyph, which disarms the trap.
As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section ofloor that orms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging
an Iron Spike or similar object under the pressure
plate prevents the trap from triggering.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the area of ef-
fect, as shown in the following table.
Levels
Fire Damage
Area of Effect
5–10
22 (4d10)
30-foot Cone
11–16
55 (10d10)
60-foot Cone
17–20
99 (18d10)
120-foot Cone
Hidden Pit
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration: Instantaneous
This 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed
rom material identical to the surrounding floor.
When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open
like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the
pit. The lid remains open thereafter.
A creature that falls into the pit takes 3 (1d6)
Bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section ofloor that orms the
pit’s lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, detecting the pit on a successful check.
Once the pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the
surrounding floor to prevent the lid rom opening,
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
be held shut using Arcane Lock or similar magic.
Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing
gear, or magic such as Spider Climb to scale the pit’s
smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape
by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as
handholds and footholds.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as
shown in the following table.
Levels
Pit Depth
Bludgeoning Damage
5–10
30 feet
10 (3d6)
11–16
60 feet
21 (6d6)
17–20
120 feet
42 (12d6)
Poisoned Darts
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the
start of the next turn if it has activated fewer than
three times
When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate or the first time on a turn, poisoned darts
shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding
walls. The holes that house these tubes are ob-
scured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden
amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.
Each creature in the darts’ path must succeed on
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3
darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check, detecting the holes on a suc-
cessful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth,
or detritus prevents the darts rom firing.
As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section ofloor that orms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging
an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure
plate prevents the trap from triggering.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing each dart’s Poison damage as
follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels
11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20.
Poisoned Needle
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature opens the trap’s lock improperly
or fails to disarm the trap
Duration: Instantaneous
A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a crea-
ture opens the lock with any object other than the
proper key, the needle springs out and stabs the
creature. The creature makes a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
5 (1d10) Poison damage and has the Poisoned

System Reference Document 5.2.1
201
condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the crea-
ture takes half as much damage only.
Avoid. The trap doesn’t trigger if the lock is
opened using a Knock spell or similar magic.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped lock and make a DC 15
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the needle on
a successful check. Once the trap is detected, a char-
acter can take an action to try to disarm the trap,
doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight
of Hand) check. On a failed check, the creature trig-
gers the trap.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as
shown in the following table.
Levels
Poison Damage
Save DC
5–10
11 (2d10)
13
11–16
22 (4d10)
15
17–20
55 (10d10)
17
Rolling Stone
Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels
17–20)
Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration: Until the stone stops rolling
When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure
plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released
from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The
stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the
stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.
On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direc-
tion, changing course if redirected by an obstacle.
The stone can move through creatures’ spaces,
and creatures can move through the stone’s space,
treating it as Dificult Terrain. Whenever the stone
enters a creature’s space or the first time on a turn
or a creature enters the stone’s space while the
stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Blud-
geoning damage and have the Prone condition.
The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar
barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative
dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into
nearby passages that allow the stone to keep
moving.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section ofloor that orms the
pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check, deducing the pressure plate’s
function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron
Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate
prevents the trap from triggering.
Destroy the Stone. The stone is a Large object
that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10,
and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
Slow the Stone. As an action, a creature can try to
slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athlet-
ics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the
stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that
distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer
a threat.
Spiked Pit
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration: Instantaneous
A 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from
material identical to the surrounding floor. When
a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like
a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit,
which has sharpened wooden or metal spikes at the
bottom. The lid remains open thereafter.
A creature that falls into the pit lands at the
bottom and takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage
from the fall plus 9 (2d8) Piercing damage from
the spikes.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section ofloor that orms the pit’s
lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once
the hidden pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the
surrounding floor to prevent the lid rom opening,
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
be held shut using an Arcane Lock spell or similar
magic.
Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing
gear, or magic such as a Spider Climb spell to scale
the pit’s smooth walls. You can make the pit easier
to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough
to serve as handholds and footholds.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as
shown in the following table.
Levels
Pit Depth
Damage
5–10
30 feet
10 (3d6) Bludgeoning plus 13

Combat Encounters
The following features can make a combat encoun-
ter more interesting or challenging:
Changes in Elevation. Terrain features that pro-
vide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty
crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever posi-
tioning and encourage characters to jump, climb,
fly, or teleport.
Defensive Positions. Enemies in hard-to-reach
locations or defensive positions force characters
who normally attack at range to move around.
Mixed Monster Groups. When different types
of monsters work together, they can combine
their abilities—just like characters with differ-
ent classes and origins. A diverse force is more
powerful.
Reasons to Move. Use features that encourage
characters and their enemies to move around,
such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and
rolling stone traps.
Combat Encounter Difficulty
Use the following guidelines to create a combat en-
counter oa desired level odificulty.
Step 1: Choose a Difﬁculty
Three categories describe the range of encounter
dificulty:
Low Dificulty. An encounter olow dificulty is
likely to have one or two scary moments for the
players, but their characters should emerge vic-
torious with no casualties. One or more of them
might need to use healing resources, however.
As a rough guideline, a single monster generally
presents a low-dificulty challenge or a party o
four characters whose level equals the monster’s
Challenge Rating.
Moderate Dificulty. Absent healing and other re-
sources, an encounter omoderate dificulty could
go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters
might get taken out othe fight, and there’s a slim
chance that one or more characters might die.
High Dificulty. A high-dificulty encounter could
be lethal for one or more characters. To survive
it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick
thinking, and maybe even a little luck.
Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget
Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-ref-
erence the party’s level with the desired encounter
dificulty. Multiply the number in the table by the
number of characters in the party to get your XP
budget for the encounter.

Step 3: Spend Your Budget
Every creature has an XP value in its stat block.
When you add a creature to your combat encounter,
deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine
how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much
of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s
OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples
are given below:
Example 1. A low-dificulty encounter or our level
1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total
of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the fol-
lowing encounters:
• 1 Bugbear Warrior (200 XP)
• 2 Giant Wasps (100 XP each), for 200 XP total
• 6 Giant Rats (25 XP each), for 150 XP total
Example 2. A moderate-dificulty encounter or
five level 3 characters has an XP budget o225 × 5,
for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build
either of these encounters:
• 2 Druids (450 XP each) and 9 Stirges (25 XP
each), for 1,125 XP total
• 1 Wight (700 XP), 1 Warhorse Skeleton (100 XP),
and 6 Skeletons (50 XP each), for 1,100 XP total

System Reference Document 5.2.1
203
Example 3. A high-dificulty encounter or six level
15 characters has an XP budget of 7,800 × 6, for a
total of 46,800 XP. With that, you could build this
encounter:
• 2 Adult Red Dragons (18,000 XP each) and 2 Fire
Giants (5,000 XP each), for 46,000 XP total
Troubleshooting
When creating and running combat encounters,
keep the following in mind.
Many Creatures
The more creatures in an encounter, the higher
the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal
more damage to the characters than you expect. If
your encounter includes more than two creatures
per character, include fragile creatures that can be
defeated quickly. This guideline is especially im-
portant for characters of level 1 or 2.
Adjustments
A player’s absence might warrant removing crea-
tures from an encounter to keep it at the intended
dificulty. Also, die rolls and other actors can result
in an encounter being easier or harder than in-
tended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such
as by having creatures flee (making the encounter
easier) or adding reinforcements (making the en-
counter harder).
CR 0 Creatures
Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that
are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you
want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter,
use swarms instead.
Number of Stat Blocks
The best combat encounters often pair one kind of
creature with another, such as fire giants paired
with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat
blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing
more than two or three stat blocks for a single en-
counter can be daunting, particularly if the crea-
tures are complex.
Powerful Creatures
If your combat encounter includes a creature whose
CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that
such a creature might deal enough damage with a
single action to take out one or more characters. For
example, an Ogre (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard
with a single blow.
Unusual Features
If a monster has a feature that lower-level charac-
ters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that
monster to an encounter for characters whose level
is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating.

Magic Items
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such
items grant capabilities a character could rarely
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s
capabilities in wondrous ways.
Magic Item Categories
Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear
after the table.
Magic Item Categories
Category
Examples
Armor
+1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield
Potions
Potion of Healing
Rings
Ring of Invisibility
Rods
Immovable Rod
Scrolls
Spell Scroll
Staffs
Staff of Striking
Wands
Wand of Fireballs
Weapons
+1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword
Wondrous Items
Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind
Armor
An item in the Armor category is typically a magical
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an ar-
mor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must
be worn for its magic to function.
Some suits of magic armor specify the type of ar-
mor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it
randomly.
Potions
An item in the Potion category might be a magical
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.
Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items.
Drinking a potion or administering it to another
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil
might take longer as specified in its description.
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it
is used up.
Mixing Potions. A character might drink one po-
tion while still under the effects of another or pour
several potions into a single container. The strange
ingredients used in creating potions can result in
unpredictable interactions.
When a character mixes two potions together, roll
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion,
combining the results. Unless the effects are imme-
diately obvious, reveal them only when they become
evident.
Potion Miscibility
1d100
Result
01
Both potions lose their effects, and the
mixture creates a magical explosion in a
5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself.
Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force
damage.
02–08
Both potions lose their effects, and the mix-
ture becomes an ingested poison of your
choice (see “Poison” in “Gameplay Toolbox”).
09–15
Both potions lose their effects.
16–25
One potion loses its effect.
26–35
Both potions work, but with their numerical
effects and durations halved. If a potion has
no numerical effect and no duration, it instead
loses its effect.
36–90
Both potions work normally.
91–99
Both potions work, but the numerical effects
and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei-
ther potion has anything to double in this way,
they work normally.
00
Only one potion works, but its effects are
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to
make permanent or the one that seems the
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maxi-
mum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might
give the drinker the Invisible condition indeﬁ-
nitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.
Rings
For its magic to function, an item in the Ring cate-
gory must be worn on a finger or a similar digit un-
less its description notes otherwise.
Rods
An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs
2 to 5 pounds.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can
be used as an Arcane Focus.

The value of a Spell Scroll is double what it costs to scribe the scroll
(as speciﬁed in the “Scribing Spell Scrolls” section of “Equipment”).
Activating a Magic Item
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic
item. The item’s user might also need to do some-
thing special. The description of each item category
or individual item details how an item is activated.
Certain items use the following rules for their
activation.
Command Word
A command word is a word or short phrase that
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spo-
ken command words must be audible and fail to
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in
the area of the Silence spell.
Consumable Items
Some items are consumed—used up, in other
words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a
consumable item loses its magic.
Spells Cast from Items
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the us-
er’s spell slots, and requires no components unless
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,
and the user of the item must concentrate if the
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items
make exceptions to these rules, changing the cast-
ing time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
A magic item may require the user to use their
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability,
their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 or the item,
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.
Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be ex-
pended to activate their properties. The number
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when
the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to
an item knows how many charges the item has and
how many it regains.
“The Next Dawn”
Magic items often have charges or properties that
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis-
tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the
GM determines when the item recharges.
Cursed Items
A magic item’s description specifies whether it
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, in-
cluding the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended volun-
tarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a
Remove Curse spell.
Magic Item Resilience
A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Po-
tions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learn-
ing how to destroy an Artifact usually requires
research or the completion of a quest.
Crafting Magic Items
“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of
Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other
magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules,
“you” refers to the character crafting the magic
item.
Arcana Proficiency
To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must
have proficiency in the Arcana skill.
Tools
The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is re-
quired to make a magic item of each category. You
must use the required tool to make an item and
have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must
also have proficiency with it. For more inormation
on the tools, see “Equipment.”

Spells
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells
from it, you must have all those spells prepared ev-
ery day you spend crafting the item.
Time and Cost
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and
money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.
Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days,
those days needn’t be consecutive.
Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts
to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed
to create an item by the number of characters work-
ing on it. Normally, only one other character can
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.
Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents
the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance
that the materials are available, and in any other
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before
checking on the availability again.
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a
purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor),
you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item
using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to
make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500
GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.

Sentient Magic Items
Some magic items have sentience and personality.
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in
the side.
Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
The GM controls sentient magic items and their
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a
good relationship with the item can access those
properties. Ithe relationship is strained, a conflict
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).
Sentient Magic Item Traits
When you make a sentient magic item, you create
the item’s persona much as you would create an
NPC, with these exceptions.
Abilities
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or de-
termine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.
Alignment
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise,
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Alignment table.
Communication
A sentient item communicates by sharing its emo-
tions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communi-
cates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication
table.
Senses
A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on
the Sentient Item’s Senses table.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
208
Special Purpose
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the
wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating
rom this course might cause conflict between the
wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can
pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Special Purpose table.

9
Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another
sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar
to itself.
10
Templar. The item seeks to defend the ser-
vants and interests of a particular deity.
Conﬂict
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner
opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict
can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus
the item’s Charisma modifier). On a ailed save, the
item makes one or more of the following demands:
Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its
bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of
all other goals.
Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dis-
pose oanything the item finds repugnant.
It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be
given to someone else.
Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or
worn at all times.
If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s de-
mands, the item can do any of the following:
• Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
• Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
• Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon
the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC
12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a ailed
save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for
1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the
bearer must try to follow the item’s commands.
If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save,
ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the
attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item
can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

Adamantine Armor
Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor),
Uncommon
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine,
one of the hardest substances in existence. While
you’re wearing it, any Critical Hit against you be-
comes a normal hit.
Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2),
or Very Rare (+3)
You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bo-
nus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition.
Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer
magical.
This ammunition is typically found or sold in
quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this
ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of
the same rarity.
Ammunition of Slaying
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare
This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures
of a particular type, which the GM chooses or de-
termines randomly by rolling on the table below. If
a creature of that type takes damage from the am-
munition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage
on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a
successful one.
After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the
ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Apparatus of the Crab
Wondrous Item, Legendary
This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden
catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20
Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the
catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, al-
lowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl
inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,
each in a neutral position, able to move up or down.
When certain levers are used, the apparatus trans-
forms to resemble a giant lobster.
The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with
the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30
ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t ex-
tended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires
one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the
compartment is airtight and watertight. The com-
partment holds enough air for 10 hours of breath-
ing, divided by the number of breathing creatures
inside.
The apparatus floats on water. It can also go
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the
vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute
from pressure.
A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize
action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s
levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right,
functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab
Levers table.
Armor, +1, +2, or +3

Armor of Vulnerability
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires
Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to
one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning,
Piercing, or Slashing. The GM chooses the type or
determines it randomly.
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed
only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or
you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you
until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or
similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the
curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two
of the three damage types associated with the ar-
mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).
Arrow-Catching Shield
Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged
attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus
is in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.
Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll
against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a
Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
Bag of Beans
Wondrous Item, Rare
This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when
found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of
how many beans it contains and becomes a non-
magical item when it no longer contains any beans.
If you dump one or more beans out of the bag,
they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on
them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the ex-
plosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including
you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking
5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt
or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it
produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect
from the following table or determine it randomly.
1d100
Effect
01
5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the
eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and
have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On
an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary
Hit Points for 1 hour.
02–10

mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s

A Treant sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd
roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even
roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.
21–30
An animate but immobile stone statue in
your likeness rises and makes verbal threats
against you. If you leave it and others come
near, it describes you as the most heinous
of villains and directs the newcomers to ﬁnd
and attack you. If you are on the same plane
of existence as the statue, it knows where
you are. The statue becomes inanimate after
24 hours.
31–40
A campﬁre with green ﬂames springs
forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is
extinguished.
41–50
Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.
51–60
1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. When-
ever a toad is touched, it transforms into a
Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice
that acts in accordance with its alignment
and nature. The monster remains for 1 min-
ute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink
smoke.
61–70
A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.
71–80
A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8
of which act as randomly determined po-
tions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked
fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.
81–90
A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs
springs up. Any creature that eats an egg
makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, a creature permanently
increases its lowest ability score by 1, ran-
domly choosing among equally low scores.
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6
Force damage from an internal explosion.
91–95
A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts
upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing
a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other
Undead of the GM’s choice. Its sarcophagus
contains treasure of the GM’s choice.
96–00
A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a
height of the GM’s choice. The top leads
where the GM chooses, such as to a great
view, a cloud giant’s castle, or another plane
of existence.

Bag of Devouring
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding
orifice or a gigantic extradimensional creature.
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
The extradimensional creature attached to the
bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag.
Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a liv-
ing creature is placed in the bag, as happens when
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A
creature inside the bag can take an action to try to
escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength
(Athletics) check. Another creature can take an ac-
tion to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, do-
ing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag
first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag
is devoured, its body destroyed.
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However,
once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside
it and spits them out into another plane of existence.
The GM determines the time and plane.
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and
anything contained within it is transported to a
random location on the Astral Plane.
Bag of Holding
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square
and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up
to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic
feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its
contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires
a Utilize action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is de-
stroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral
Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right
before it can be used again. The bag holds enough
air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the num-
ber of breathing creatures inside.
Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimen-
sional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable
Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate orig-
inates where the one item was placed inside the
other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere
centered on the gate is sucked through it to a ran-
dom location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.
Bag of Tricks
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears
empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals
the presence of a small, fuzzy object.
You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy ob-
ject from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When
the object lands, it transforms into a creature you
determine by rolling on the table that corresponds
to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s
stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn
or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
The creature is Friendly to you and your allies,
and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative
count. You can take a Bonus Action to command
how the creature moves and what action it takes on
its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the ab-
sence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion
appropriate to its nature.
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from
the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next
dawn.

Bead of Force
Wondrous Item, Rare
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4
Beads of Force are found together.
You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up
to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius
Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature

System Reference Document 5.2.1
213
in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere
of transparent force then encloses the area for 1
minute. Any creature that failed the save and is
completely within the area is trapped inside this
sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are
partially within the area are pushed away from the
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside
it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s
wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.
An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to
push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere
up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be
picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1
pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.
Bead of Nourishment
Wondrous Item, Common
This flavorless, gelatinous bead dissolves on your
tongue and provides as much nourishment as 1 day
of Rations.

lowing additional benefits while wearing the belt:
Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60
feet.

Berserker Axe
Weapon (Battleaxe, Greataxe, or Halberd), Rare
(Requires Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. In addition, while
you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Point
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have
attained.
Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming at-
tuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you
remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the
weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You
also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weap-
ons other than this one.
Whenever another creature damages you while
the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed
on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This
berserk state ends when you start your turn and
there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you
can see or hear.
While berserk, you regard the creature nearest
to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If
there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at
random. On each of your turns, you must move as
close to the creature as possible and take the Attack
action, targeting the creature. If you’re unable to
get close enough to the creature to attack it with
the weapon, your turn ends after you’ve used up all
your available movement. If the creature dies or can
no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest
creature that you can see or hear becomes your
new target.

across. You also have Advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks.

When you’ve used the boots’ property for a total
of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you
until you finish a Long Rest.
Boots of Striding and Springing

As a Magic action, you can send the broom to
travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if
you name the location and are familiar with it. The
broom comes back to you when you take a Magic
action and use a command word if the broom is still
within 1 mile of you.
Candle of Invocation
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning
for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff
it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time
it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total
burn time.
While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-oot
radius. While you are within that light, you have

Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have
prepared without expending spell slots.

That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 2d10 Poison damage and have
the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The weapon
can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

Dancing Sword
Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or
Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic
weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon
begins to hover, flies up to 30 eet, and attacks one
creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The
weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability
modifier to damage rolls.
While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus
Action to cause it to fly up to 30 eet to another spot
within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Ac-
tion, you can cause the weapon to attack one crea-
ture within 5 feet of the weapon.
After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth
time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your
hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to
the ground in your space. If the weapon has no un-
obstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as
it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to
hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away
from it.
Decanter of Endless Water
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as iit
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.
You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper
and issue one of three command words, whereupon
an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice)
pours out othe flask. The water stops pouring out
at the start of your next turn. Choose from the fol-
lowing command words:
Splash. The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.
Fountain. The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.
Geyser. The decanter produces 30 gallons of water
that gushes orth in a Line 30 eet long and 1 oot
wide. If you’re holding the decanter, you can aim
the geyser in one direction (no action required).
One creature oyour choice in the Line must suc-
ceed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take
1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone con-
dition. Instead of a creature, you can target one
object in the Line that isn’t being worn or carried
and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The
object is knocked over by the geyser.
Deck of Illusions
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34
cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with
a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usu-
ally missing 1d20 −1 cards.
The magic of the deck functions only if its cards
are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action
to draw a card at random from the deck and throw
it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself.
An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown
card and remains until dispelled. The illusory crea-
ture created by the card looks and behaves like a
real creature of its kind, except that it can do no
harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory
creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action
to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.
Any physical interaction with the illusory crea-
ture reveals it to be false, because objects pass
through it. A creature that takes a Study action to
visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as
an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card
is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel
Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion
ends, the image on its card disappears, and that
card can’t be used again.

Defender
Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Legendary (Requires
Attunement)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
The first time you attack with the weapon on each
of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the
weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example,
you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and
damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor
Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until
the start of your next turn, although you must hold
the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.
Demon Armor
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare
(Requires Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition,
the armor’s clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed
Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the
usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus
to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed
Strikes.
Curse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t
doff it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse
spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor,
you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against de-
mons and on saving throws against their spells and
special abilities.
Dimensional Shackles
Wondrous Item, Rare
You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles
on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition.
The shackles adjust to fit a creature oSmall to
Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound
by them from using any method of extradimen-
sional movement, including teleportation or travel
to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent
the creature from passing through an interdimen-
sional portal.
You and any creature you designate when you
use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove
them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can
make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a suc-
cessful check, the creature breaks free and destroys
the shackles.
Dragon Orb
Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in
diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic
action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success-
ful save, you control the orb for as long as you re-
main attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes
the Charmed condition on you for as long as you
remain attuned to it.
While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t
voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb
casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The
dragon essence within the orb might want many
things: the annihilation of a particular society or or-
ganization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffer-
ing in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat,
or something else the GM decides.
Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3
expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the
orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following
table from it. The table indicates how many charges
you must expend to cast the spell.
Spell

Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you
can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a
telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40
miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled
to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most
direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are un-
affected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to
the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling
them against their will. Once you have used this
property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.
Destroying an Orb. A Dragon Orb has AC 20 and is
destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a
Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.
Dragon Scale Mail
Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind
of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off

System Reference Document 5.2.1
219
scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully
preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case,
Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws
against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you
have Resistance to one damage type determined by
the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the
accompanying table).
Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic
action to discern the distance and direction to the
closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is
of the same type as the armor. This action can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

Dragon Slayer
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Rare
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
The weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the
weapon’s type if the target is a Dragon.
Dust of Disappearance
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough
of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to
throw the dust into the air, you and each creature
and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating
from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 min-
utes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and
the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect.
Immediately after an affected creature makes an at-
tack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible
condition ends for that creature.
Dust of Dryness
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust.
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the
dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of
water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats
or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The
pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take
a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard
surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the
water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pel-
let and ends its magic.
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the
dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that
is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Ele-
mental). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the
dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, tak-
ing 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one.
Dust of Sneezing and Choking
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
Found in a small container, this powder resembles
Dust of Disappearance, and Identify reveals it to be
such. There is enough of it for one use.
As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the
air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot
Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals,
Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save
automatically.
On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing un-
controllably; it has the Incapacitated condition and
is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. The effect also ends on any creature tar-
geted by a Lesser Restoration spell.
Dwarven Plate
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Very Rare
While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to
Armor Class. In addition, if an effect moves you
against your will along the ground, you can take a
Reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by
up to 10 feet.
Dwarven Thrower
Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement by a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt
of Dwarvenkind)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown
property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long
range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack
using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force dam-
age, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is
a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the
weapon flies back to your hand.
Efﬁcient Quiver
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects
to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver
to hold numerous items while never weighing more
than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold
up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The mid-
size compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar
objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long
objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.
You can draw any item the quiver contains as if
doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Efreeti Bottle
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper
of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke
flows out oit. At the end oyour turn, the smoke dis-
appears with a flash oharmless fire, and an Efreeti
appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on
the following table to determine what happens.
1d10
Effect
1
The efreeti attacks you. After ﬁghting for 5
rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle
loses its magic.
2–9
The efreeti understands your languages and
obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which
it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper
contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for
24 hours. The next two times the bottle is
opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is
opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and
disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
10
The efreeti understands your languages and can
cast Wish once for you. It disappears when it
grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle
loses its magic.
Elemental Gem
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This gem contains a mote of elemental energy.
When you take a Utilize action to break the gem,
an elemental is summoned (see “Monsters” for its
stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The
elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close
to the broken gem as possible, understands your
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its
turn immediately after you on your Initiative count.
The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies,
or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type
of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the
following table.
Gem
Summoned Elemental
Blue sapphire
Air Elemental
Emerald
Water Elemental
Red corundum
Fire Elemental
Yellow diamond
Earth Elemental
Elixir of Health
Potion, Rare
When you drink this potion, you are cured of all
magical contagions. In addition, the following con-
ditions end on you: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed,
and Poisoned.
The clear, red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
Elven Chain
Armor (Chain Mail or Chain Shirt), Rare
You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while you wear
this armor. You are considered trained with this ar-
mor even if you lack training with Medium or Heavy
armor.
Energy Bow
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon, which has no string.
Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion,
a magical arrow made of golden energy appears
nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by
this weapon deals Force damage instead of Pierc-
ing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits
or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow
emits Bright Light in a 20-oot radius and Dim Light
for an additional 20 feet.
This weapon has the following additional
properties.
Arrow of Restraint. Whenever you use this
weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature,
you can try to restrain the target instead of deal-
ing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have
the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action,
a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC
20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the
restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful
check.
Arrow of Transport. As a Magic action, you can
fire one energy arrow rom this weapon at a target
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target
can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature
or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, pro-
vided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-oot
Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccu-
pied space you can see within 10 feet of you.
Energy Ladder. As a Magic action, you can loose a
flurry oenergy arrows rom this weapon at a wall
up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows be-
come glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, form-
ing a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall.
This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.
Eversmoking Bottle
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.
Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow
out, orming a cloud that fills a 60-oot Emanation
originating from the bottle. The area within the
smoke is Heavily Obscured.
Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of
the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches
its maximum size of 120 feet.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
221
Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become
fixed in place until it disperses ater 10 minutes.
A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of
Wind spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
Eyes of Charming
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have
3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend
1 or more charges to cast Charm Person (save DC
13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the
spell. You increase the spell’s level by one for each
additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all
expended charges daily at dawn.
Eyes of Minute Seeing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wear-
ing them, your vision improves significantly out to a
range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that
range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation)
checks made to examine something within that
range.
Eyes of the Eagle
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wear-
ing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of
clear visibility, you can make out details of even
extremely distant creatures and objects as small as
2 feet across.
Feather Token
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies
This object looks like a feather. Different types of
feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use
effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or deter-
mines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens
table. The type of token determines its rarity.
Anchor (Uncommon). You can take a Magic action
to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next
24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the ef-
fect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.
Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss
the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears
and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.
The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can’t at-
tack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry
up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum
speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144
miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of
flying) or 1,000 pounds at halthat speed. The bird
disappears ater flying its maximum distance or a
day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the
bird as a Magic action.
Fan (Uncommon). If you are on a boat or ship,
you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to
10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant
flapping an takes its place. The an floats and cre-
ates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails oone
ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8
hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.
Swan Boat (Rare). You can take a Magic action to
touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet
in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-
long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its
place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across
water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take
a Magic action while on the boat to command it to
move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains
for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss
the boat as a Magic action.
Tree (Uncommon). You must be outdoors to use
this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it
to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree
springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and
has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the
top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
Whip (Rare). You can take a Magic action to
throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself.
The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its
place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a
melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet
of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the
target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.
As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly
up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature
within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after
1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or
when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.

Figurine of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies
A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small
enough to fit in a pocket. Iyou take a Magic ac-
tion to throw the figurine to a point on the ground
within 60 eet oyoursel, the figurine becomes a
living creature specified in the figurine’s descrip-
tion below. If the space where the creature would
appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or

System Reference Document 5.2.1
222
ithere isn’t enough space or the creature, the figu-
rine doesn’t become a creature.
The creature is Friendly to you and your allies.
It understands your languages, obeys your com-
mands, and takes its turn immediately after you on
your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.
The creature exists or a duration specific to each
figurine. At the end othe duration, the creature
reverts to its figurine orm. It reverts to a figurine
early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if
you take a Magic action while touching the creature
to make it revert to figurine orm. When the crea-
ture becomes a figurine again, its property can’t
be used again until a certain amount of time has
passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.
Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of
a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to
6 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again
until 5 days have passed.
Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette, carved in
the likeness oa horsefly, can become a Giant Fly
(see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours
and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used,
it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.

Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of
lions are always created in pairs. You can use one
figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become
a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it
can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of
goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat
looks unique and functions differently from the oth-
ers. Their properties are as follows:
Goat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant
Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but
you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use
them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance,
and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing
a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons
disappear and the horns return when the goat
reverts to figurine orm. While you ride the goat,
any Hostile creature that starts its turn within
a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until
you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat
reverts to figurine orm. The Frightened creature
repeats the save at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it
succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to
this eect or the next 24 hours. Once the figurine
has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days
have passed.
Goat of Traveling. This figurine can become a
Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding
Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or por-
tion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge.
While it has charges, you can use it as often as you
wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a
figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have
passed, when it regains all expended charges.
Goat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant
Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it
can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.
Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette
resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an
Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used,
it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished ob-
sidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24
hours. The nightmare fights only to deend itsel.
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5
days have passed.
The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time
you use it to ignore your orders, including a com-
mand to revert to figurine orm. Iyou mount the
nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you
and the nightmare are instantly transported to a
random location on the plane of Hades, where the
nightmare reverts to figurine orm.
Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can
become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has
an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also
has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has
been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have
passed.
Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette
of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours.
The owl can communicate telepathically with you at
any range if you and it are on the same plane of ex-
istence. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again
until 2 days have passed.
Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette
of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours.
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2

Handy Haversack
Wondrous Item, Rare
This backpack has a central pouch and two side
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional
space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds
of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet.
The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of ma-
terial, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The
haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its
contents.
Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a
Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When
you reach into the haversack or a specific item, the
item is always magically on top.
If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or
torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever,
although an Artifact always turns up again some-
where. If the haversack is turned inside out, its con-
tents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must
be put right before it can be used again.
Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for
10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of
breathing creatures inside.
Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be
reopened.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
225
Unknown Spell. While holding the hat, you can
try to cast a level 1+ spell you don’t know. The spell
must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level
you can cast, and it can’t have Material components
costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on
the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s
level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell,
make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus
the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the
spell using its normal casting time, and you can’t
use this property again until you finish a Short or
Long Rest. On a ailed check, you ail to cast the
spell and a random effect occurs instead, deter-
mined by rolling on the following table.
Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell
save DC and spell attack bonus.

Horn of Blasting
Wondrous Item, Rare
You can take a Magic action to blow the horn, which
emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot Cone that is
audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the Cone
makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage
and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a
successful save, a creature takes half as much dam-
age only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that
aren’t being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder
damage.
Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent
chance of causing the horn to explode. The ex-
plosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and
destroys the horn.
Horn of Valhalla
Wondrous Item, Rare (Silver or Brass), Very Rare
(Bronze), or Legendary (Iron)
You can take a Magic action to blow this horn. In
response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard
appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you.
Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and re-
turns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0
Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing
warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed
and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it
can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to ex-
ist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type
determines how many spirits it summons, as well
as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the

ment, the summoned spirits attack you. If you meet

Horseshoes of a Zephyr
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the
horseshoe afixes itselto the hoo. Removing a
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
While all our shoes are afixed to the hooves oa
horse or similar creature, they allow the creature
to move normally while floating 4 inches above a
surface. This effect means the creature can cross
or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such
as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and
ignores Dificult Terrain. In addition, the creature
can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining
Exhaustion levels from extended travel.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Horseshoes of Speed
Wondrous Item, Rare
These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the
horseshoe afixes itselto the hoo. Removing a
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
While all four horseshoes are attached to the
same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.
Immovable Rod
Rod, Uncommon
This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take
a Utilize action to press the button, which causes
the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you
or another creature takes a Utilize action to push
the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it
defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds
of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate
and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make
a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed
rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.
Instant Fortress
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch
adamantine statuette on the ground and, using
a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a
square adamantine tower. Repeating the command
word causes the tower to revert to statuette form,
which works only if the tower is empty. Each crea-
ture in the area where the tower appears is pushed
to an unoccupied space outside but next to the
tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or
carried are also pushed clear of the tower.
The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high,
with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop
it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a lad-
der, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting
them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trap-
door leading to the roof. When created, the tower
has a single door at ground level on the side facing
you. The door opens only at your command, which
you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the
Knock spell and similar magic.
Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over.
The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20;
HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege
equipment; and Resistance to all other damage.
Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form
doesn’t repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish
spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell
counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower).
Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all
its Hit Points.
Ioun Stone
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)
Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after
Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on
some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each
type a distinct combination of shape and color.
When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun
Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a
distance o1d3 eet, conerring its benefit to you
while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones
orbiting your head at the same time.
Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered
to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone
avoids contact with other creatures and objects, ad-
justing its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all
attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.
As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any
number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your
Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it’s orbit-
ing your head, the stone falls as though you had
dropped it.
The type of stone determines its rarity and
effects.
Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction
to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a crea-
ture you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and
any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the
stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out,
turns dull gray, and loses its magic.
Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere
orbits your head.
Awareness (Rare). While this dark-blue rhomboid
orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative
rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution in-
creases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink
rhomboid orbits your head.
Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this mar-
bled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head,
you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8
or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled
spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast
it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 lev-
els of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses
its magic.
Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue
sphere orbits your head.
Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet
and blue sphere orbits your head.
Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink
and green sphere orbits your head.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Mastery (Legendary). Your Proficiency Bonus in-
creases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your
head.
Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Armor
Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head.
Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit
Points at the end of each hour this pearly white
spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit
Point.
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them.
The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time.
When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells
chosen by the GM.
Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the
stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is
expended without effect. The level of the slot used
to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast
any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level,
spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcast-
ing ability of the original caster but is otherwise
treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from
the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhom-
boid orbits your head.
Sustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink
while this clear spindle orbits your head.
Iron Bands
Wondrous Item, Rare
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diame-
ter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action
to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere
moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of
metal bands.
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Profi-
ciency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained
condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a
command that releases it. Doing so or missing with
the attack causes the bands to contract and become
a sphere once more.
A creature that can touch the bands, including the
one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20
Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands.
On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the
Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any
further attempts made by that creature automati-
cally fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again
until the next dawn.
Iron Flask
Wondrous Item, Legendary
While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you
can take a Magic action to target a creature that
you can see within 60 eet oyoursel. Ithe flask
is empty and the target is native to a plane of exis-
tence other than the one you’re on, the target must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be
trapped in the flask. Ithe target has been trapped
by the flask beore, it has Advantage on the save.
Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until
released. The flask can hold only one creature at a
time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink.
You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s
stopper and release the creature in the flask. The
creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour,
understanding those commands even if it doesn’t
know the language in which the commands are
given. If you issue no commands or give the crea-
ture a command that is likely to result in its death
or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise
takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the
creature acts in accordance with its normal disposi-
tion and alignment.
An Identify spell reveals ithe flask contains a
creature, but the only way to determine the type
ocreature is to open the flask. A newly discovered
Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen
by the GM.
Javelin of Lightning
Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon
Each time you make an attack roll with this magic
weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning dam-
age instead of Piercing damage.
Lightning Bolt. When you throw this weapon at
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can
forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn
the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms
a 5-oot-wide Line between you and the target. The
target and each other creature in the Line (exclud-
ing you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, tak-
ing 4d6 Lightning damage on a ailed save or hal
as much damage on a successful one. Immediately
after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in
your hand. This property can’t be used again until
the next dawn.
Lantern of Revealing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1
pint ooil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-oot radius

Scimitar, Sickle, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires
Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is
on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving
throws.
Luck. If the weapon is on your person, you can call

tion. You must use the second roll. Once used, this
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Wish. The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding
it, you can expend 1 charge and cast Wish from it.

has no charges.
Mace of Disruption
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)
When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant
damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer
after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC
15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature has the Frightened condi-
tion until the end of your next turn.
Light. While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright
Light in a 20-oot radius and Dim Light or an addi-
tional 20 feet.
Mace of Smiting
Weapon (Mace), Rare
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage
rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus in-
creases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a
Construct.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with
this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeon-
ing damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it’s a
Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer
after taking this damage, it is destroyed.
Mace of Terror
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)
This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding

pend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it.
Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While
Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its
turns trying to move as far away from you as it can,
and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks. For its ac-
tion, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it
has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the
Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a crea-
ture repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on
a success.
Mantle of Spell Resistance
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells
while you wear this cloak.
Manual of Bodily Health
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
This book contains health and nutrition tips, and
its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48
hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the
book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your
Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 30.
The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a
century.
Manual of Gainful Exercise
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
This book describes fitness exercises, and its words
are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over
a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s con-
tents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength in-
creases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then
loses its magic but regains it in a century.
Manual of Golems
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
This tome contains information and incantations
necessary to make a particular type of golem. The
GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by
rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and
use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at
least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t
use a Manual of Golems and attempts to read it takes
6d6 Psychic damage.
To create a golem, you must spend the time shown
on the table, working without interruption with the
manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours
per day. You must also pay the specified cost to pur-
chase supplies.
Once you finish creating the golem, the book is
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes
animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled
on it. See “Monsters” for the golem’s stat block. The
golem is under your control, and it understands and
obeys your commands.

ercises, and its words are charged with magic.
If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or
fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing
its guidelines, your Dexterity increases by 2, to a
maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic
but regains it in a century.
Marvelous Pigments
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots opigment
and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).
Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment,
you can paint any number of three-dimensional
objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors,
trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided
these elements are all confined to a 20-oot Cube.
The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the num-
ber of elements you create), during which time you
must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentra-
tion. If your Concentration is broken or you leave
the Cube before the work is done, all the painted
elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.
When the work is done, all the painted objects
and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a
door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be
opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates
a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within
the 20-foot Cube.
No object created by a pot of pigment can have a
value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all
objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500
GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a
large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close in-
spection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies,
or some other worthless material.
Iyou paint a orm oenergy such as fire or light-
ning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete
the painting, doing no harm.
Medallion of Thoughts
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you
can expend 1 charge to cast Detect Thoughts (save
DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended
charges daily at dawn.
Mirror of Life Trapping
Wondrous Item, Very Rare
When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed
indirectly, its surface shows faint images of crea-
tures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC
11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage,
and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shat-
ters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and
you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic
action and use a command word to activate it. It
remains activated until you take a Magic action and
repeat the command word to deactivate it.
Any creature other than you that sees its reflec-
tion in the activated mirror while within 30 feet
of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it
is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve
extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the
mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage,
and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse
filled with thick og that reduces visibility to 10
feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t
age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A
creature trapped within a cell can escape using
magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the
creature is confined to the cell until reed.
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve ex-
tradimensional cells are already occupied, the mir-
ror frees one trapped creature at random to accom-
modate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears
in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror
but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered,
all creatures it contains are freed and appear in un-
occupied spaces near it.
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a
Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or
call out a particular cell by number. The creature
named or contained in the named cell appears as an
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature
can then communicate.
In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and
use a second command word to free one creature
trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
Total Cover is sucked through it to a random loca-
tion on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The
gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

Mithral Armor
Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor),
Uncommon
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made othis
substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the
armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the
mithral version of the armor doesn’t.
Mysterious Deck
Wondrous Item, Legendary
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most
(75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but
some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column
of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly deter-
mining cards drawn from the deck.
Before you draw a card, you must declare how
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them
randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this num-
ber have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a
card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must
draw each card no more than 1 hour after the pre-
vious draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number,
the remaining number ocards fly rom the deck on
their own and take effect all at once.
Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the
card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the
deck, making it possible to draw the same card
twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, re-
roll on the table if that card comes up again.)

Each card’s effect is described below.
Balance. You can increase one of your ability
scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also
decrease another one of your ability scores by 2.
You can’t decrease an ability that has a score of 5
or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to ad-
just your ability scores, in which case this card has
no effect.
Comet. The next time you enter combat against
one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one
of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you
reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat,
you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1
year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0
Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no
effect.
Donjon. You disappear and become entombed
in a state of suspended animation in an extradi-
mensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and
carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts,
which stay behind in the space you occupied when
you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you
are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t
be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell
can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no
more cards.
Euryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses
you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while
cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the
Fates card can end this curse.
Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, al-
lowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never
happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon
as you draw the card or at any other time before
you die.
Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy.
The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savor-
ing your suffering before attempting to slay you.
This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.
Fool. You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the
next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t
count as one of your declared draws.
Gem. Twenty-five pieces ojewelry worth 2,000
GP each or fity gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at
your feet.

System Reference Document 5.2.1
232
Jester. You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the
next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards
beyond your declared draws.
Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which
you are proficient appears on your person. The GM
chooses the weapon.
Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who
magically appears in an unoccupied space you
choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the
same alignment as you and serves you loyally until
death, believing the two of you have been drawn to-
gether by fate. Work with your GM to create a name
and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a differ-
ent stat block to represent the knight, as desired.
Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.
Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or
Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You
can draw one additional card beyond your declared
draws.
Rogue. An NPC of the GM’s choice becomes Hostile
toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC
until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less
than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the
NPC’s hostility toward you.
Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own,
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the
least. Any documentation that proves you should
own something lost to this card also disappears.
Sage. At any time you choose within one year of
drawing this card, you can ask a question in medita-
tion and mentally receive a truthful answer to that
question.
Skull. An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying
stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close
to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with
its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a
tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe.
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points
or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the
avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death.
The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as
close to that ally as possible and targets only that
ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each
summon only one avatar as a consequence of this
draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored
to life.
Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a
maximum of 24.
Sun. A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on
your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit
Points daily at dawn until you die.
Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry
disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish
instead.
Throne. You gain proficiency and Expertise in
your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Per-
suasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of
a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the
keep is currently home to one or more monsters,
which must be cleared out before you can claim the
keep as yours.
Void. Your soul is drawn from your body and
contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice.
One or more powerful beings guard the place. While
your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert,
ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A
Wish spell can’t return your soul to your body, but
the spell reveals the location of the object that holds
your soul. You draw no more cards.

Necklace of Fireballs
Wondrous Item, Rare
This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it.
You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and
throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end
of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 Fire-
ball (save DC 15).
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole
necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the
damage of the Fireball by 1d6 for each bead after
the first (maximum 12d6).
Necklace of Prayer Beads
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a
Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)
This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber,
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead
loses its magic.
Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it
randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace
can have more than one bead of the same type. To
use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each
bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a
Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is
necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that
bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Nine Lives Stealer
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
Life Stealing. The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges.
When you attack a creature that has fewer than
100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the
d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain
instantly as the sword tears its life force from its
body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save
automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the
creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges
remaining, it loses this property.
Oathbow
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in
Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter
or sign the following command words: “Swift death
to you who have wronged me.” The target of your
attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or
until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such
sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy
dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.
When you make a ranged attack roll with this
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Ad-
vantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no
benefit rom HalCover or Three-Quarters Cover,
and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range.
If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra
3d6 Piercing damage.
While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disad-
vantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
Oil of Etherealness
Potion, Rare
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and
carrying (one additional vial is required for each
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the
effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.
Beads of this cloudy, gray oil form on the outside
of its container and quickly evaporate.
Oil of Sharpness
Potion, Very Rare
One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or
twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition
and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal
Slashing or Piercing damage are affected. Applying
the oil takes 1 minute, after which the oil magically
seeps into whatever it coats, turning the coated
weapon into a +3 Weapon or the coated ammunition
into +3 Ammunition.
This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny,
ultrathin silver shards.
Oil of Slipperiness
Potion, Uncommon
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and
carrying (one additional vial is required for each
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the ef-
fect of the Freedom of Movement spell for 8 hours.
Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground
as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square,

System Reference Document 5.2.1
234
duplicating the effect of the Grease spell in that area
for 8 hours.
This sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy, but
it flows quickly when poured.
Pearl of Power
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by
a Spellcaster)
While this pearl is on your person, you can take a
Magic action to regain one expended spell slot of
level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be
used again until the next dawn.
Periapt of Health
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this pendant, you can take a Magic
action to regain 2d4 + 2 Hit Points. Once used, this
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
In addition, you have Advantage on saving throws
to avoid or end the Poisoned condition while you
wear this pendant.
Periapt of Proof against Poison
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black
gem pendant. While you wear it, you have Immunity
to the Poisoned condition and Poison damage.
Periapt of Wound Closure
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this pendant, you gain the following
benefits.
Life Preservation. Whenever you make a Death
Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to
a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.
Natural Healing Boost. Whenever you roll a Hit
Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of
Hit Points it restores.
Philter of Love
Potion, Uncommon
The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes
after drinking this philter, you are charmed by that
creature and have the Charmed condition for 1
hour.
This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one
easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
Pipes of Haunting
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic
action to play them and expend 1 charge to create
an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your
choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC
15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened
condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save
repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A creature that suc-
ceeds on its save is immune to the effect of these
pipes for 24 hours.
Pipes of the Sewers
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats
and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won’t
attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes
as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to
expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm
of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats
are within half a mile of you to be called in this
fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t
enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted.
Called swarms move toward the music by the short-
est available route but aren’t under your control
otherwise.
Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn’t under an-
other creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you
while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and
can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24
hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the
pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your
allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes
each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm
obeys your commands. If you issue no commands
to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise
takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn
more than 30 feet away from you, your control over
that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it nor-
mally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ mu-
sic for the next 24 hours.
Plate Armor of Etherealness
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary
(Requires Attunement)
While you’re wearing this armor, you can take a
Magic action and use a command word to gain the
effect of the Etherealness spell. The spell ends imme-
diately if you remove the armor or take a Magic ac-
tion to repeat the command word. This property of
the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Portable Hole
Wondrous Item, Rare
This fine black cloth, sot as silk, is olded up to the
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a cir-
cular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
You can take a Magic action to unfold a Por-
table Hole and place it on or against a solid sur-
face, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an

System Reference Document 5.2.1
235
extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical
space within the hole exists on a different plane
of existence, so it can’t be used to create open pas-
sages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole
can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
You can take a Magic action to close a Portable
Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and
folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and
any creatures or objects within remain in the ex-
tradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the
hole weighs next to nothing.
If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s
extradimensional space can take an action to make
a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful
check, the creature forces its way out and appears
within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable
Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, di-
vided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional
space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be
reopened.

into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast.
The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the
ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is ex-
pended without effect. The level of the slot used to
cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell
stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save

cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no lon-
ger stored in it, freeing up space.

both with a range of 120 feet.
Drawbacks. A Light spell cast on the robe or a
Daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives
you the Blinded condition for 1 minute. At the end of
each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving

the condition on yourself on a success.

Portable Ram
Rod of Absorption
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t
create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect
is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell it-
self—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same
level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell
dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to
cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up
to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence.
Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t ab-
sorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod
can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.
When you become attuned to the rod, you know
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed
over the course of its existence and how many levels
of spell energy it currently has stored.
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast
spells you have prepared or know. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use
the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise
cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3
levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.
A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of
spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer
absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining
becomes nonmagical.
Rod of Alertness
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This rod has the following properties.
Alertness. While holding the rod, you have
Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on
Initiative rolls.
Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the fol-
lowing spells from it:
• Detect Evil and Good
• Detect Magic
• Detect Poison and Disease
• See Invisibility
Protective Aura. As a Magic action, you can plant
the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon
the rod’s head sheds Bright Light in a 60-oot radius
and Dim Light or an additional 60 eet. While in
that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1
bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can
sense the location of any Invisible creature that is
also in the Bright Light.
The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends
after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic
action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used,
this property can’t be used again until the next
dawn.
Rod of Lordly Might
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
This rod has a flanged head, and it unctions as a
magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls
and damage rolls made with it. The rod has proper-
ties associated with six different buttons that are
set in a row along the haft. It has three other prop-
erties as well, detailed below.
Buttons. You can press one of the following but-
tons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until
you push a different button or until you push the
same button again, which causes the rod to revert
to its normal form:
Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts rom the end op-
posite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed
Bright Light in a 40-oot radius and Dim Light or
an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as
a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice)
that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.
Button 2. The rod’s flanged head olds down and
two crescent-shaped blades spring out, trans-
forming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants
a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made
with it.
Button 3. The rod’s flanged head olds down, a
spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the
rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, trans-
forming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a
+3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made
with it.
Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole
up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though
the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bot-
tom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole.
Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the
sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can
bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of
solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its
normal form.
Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld
battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.
Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its nor-
mal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing
happens if this function of the rod is used in a

System Reference Document 5.2.1
242
location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth
beneath the ground or your height above it.
Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee
attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic dam-
age, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to
half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee
attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1
minute. The target repeats the save at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
Once used, this property can’t be used again until
the next dawn.
Terrify. While holding the rod, you can take a
Magic action to force each creature you can see
within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the
Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened
target repeats the save at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once
used, this property can’t be used again until the
next dawn.
Rod of Resurrection
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can
cast one of the following spells from it: Heal (ex-
pends 1 charge) or Resurrection (expends 5 charges).
The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn.
If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the
rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
Rod of Rulership
Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement)
You can take a Magic action to present the rod and
command obedience from each creature of your
choice that you can see within 120 feet of your-
self. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8
hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature re-
gards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or
your allies or commanded to do something contrary
to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this
way. Once used, this property can’t be used again
until the next dawn.
Rod of Security
Rod, Very Rare
While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action
to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you
and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see
to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane
takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern,
an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic car-
nival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless
of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water
and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s
environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything
else that can be interacted with there can exist
only there. For example, a flower picked rom a
garden there disappears if it is taken outside the
demiplane.
For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor
regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die.
Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time
passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to
200 days divided by the number of creatures pres-
ent (round down).
When the time runs out or you take a Magic action
to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the loca-
tion they occupied when you activated the rod or an
unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used,
this property can’t be used again until 10 days have
passed.
Rope of Climbing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000
pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can
take a Magic action to command the other end of the
rope to animate and move toward a destination you
choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That
end moves 10 eet on your turn when you first com-
mand it and 10 feet at the start of each of your sub-
sequent turns until reaching its destination or until
you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten
itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to
knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at
1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the
rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advan-
tage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.
The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi-
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
Rope of Entanglement
Wondrous Item, Rare
This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of
the rope, you can take a Magic action to command
the other end to dart forward and entangle one
creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or have the Restrained condition. You can re-
lease the target by letting go of your end of the rope
(causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space)
or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command
(causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

System Reference Document 5.2.1
243
A target Restrained by the rope can take an action
to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check,
the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If
you’re still holding onto the rope when a target es-
capes from it, you can take a Reaction to command
the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope
coils up in the target’s space.
The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi-
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
Scarab of Protection
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
This beetle-shaped medallion provides three bene-
fits while it is on your person.
Defense. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
Preservation. The scarab has 12 charges. If you
fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or
a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you
can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the
failed save into a successful one. The scarab crum-
bles into powder and is destroyed when its last
charge is expended.
Spell Resistance. You have Advantage on saving
throws against spells.
Scimitar of Speed
Weapon (Scimitar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can
make one attack with it as a Bonus Action on each of
your turns.
Sending Stones
Wondrous Item, Uncommon
Sending Stones come in pairs, with each stone
carved to match the other so the pairing is easily
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can cast
Sending from it. The target is the bearer of the other
stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you
know that fact as soon as you use the stone, and you
don’t cast the spell.
Once Sending is cast using either stone, the stones
can’t be used again until the next dawn. If one of the
stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes
nonmagical.
Sentinel Shield
Armor (Shield), Uncommon
While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on
Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
The Shield is emblazoned with a symbol of an eye.
Shield, +1, +2, or +3
Armor (Shield), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very
Rare (+3)
While holding this Shield, you have a bonus to Ar-
mor Class determined by the Shield’s rarity, in addi-
tion to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.
Shield of Missile Attraction
Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to
damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.
Curse. This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses
you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell
or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to
end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a
Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet
of you, the curse causes you to become the target
instead.
Shield of the Cavalier
Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to
Armor Class. This bonus is in addition to the Shield’s
normal bonus to AC.
The Shield has the following additional properties
that you can use while holding it.
Forceful Bash. When you take the Attack action,
you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield
against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your
Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the at-
tack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to
the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength mod-
ifier, and ithe target is a creature, you can push
it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the
creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock
it down, giving it the Prone condition.
Protective Field. As a Reaction, when you or an
ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by
an attack or makes a saving throw against an area
of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immo-
bile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When
the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not
fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest
unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of
effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on
creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which
lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1
minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emana-
tion. A creature or object inside the Emanation can’t
be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation
damage anything outside it. Once this property is
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Slippers of Spider Climbing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While you wear these light shoes, you can move
up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along
ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a
Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slip-
pers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
Sovereign Glue
Wondrous Item, Legendary
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a per-
manent adhesive bond between any two objects. It
must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated
inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a con-
tainer contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square
surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes
a Utilize action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute
to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be
broken only by the application of Universal Solvent
or Oil of Etherealness, or with a Wish spell.
Spellguard Shield
Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects, and spell attack rolls have Disadvantage
against you.
Spell Scroll
Scroll, Rarity Varies
A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, writ-
ten in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell with-
out Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is
unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the
spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the cast-
ing is interrupted, the scroll isn’t lost.
If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level
than you can normally cast, you make an ability
check using your spellcasting ability to determine
whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus
the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disap-
pears from the scroll with no other effect.
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as
the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the following table.

Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook. A Wizard spell
on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook.
When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must
succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a
DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful
check, the spell is copied. Whether the check suc-
ceeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed.
Sphere of Annihilation
Wondrous Item, Legendary
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a
magical field surrounding it.
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes
through and all matter that passes through it. Ar-
tifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is sus-
ceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it
passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else
that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed
and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.
Controlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation is
stationary until someone takes control of it. If you
are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic
action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
On a successful check, you control the sphere until
the start of your next turn, and if it was under an-
other creature’s control, that creature loses control
of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves
10 feet toward you in a straight line.
While in control of the sphere, you can take a
Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction
of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to
5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5
feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters
must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw
or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A
creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is
obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no
other physical remains.
Sphere Interactions. If the sphere comes into
contact with a planar portal (such as that created by
the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such
as that within a Portable Hole), the GM determines
randomly what happens using the following table.

Languages from it using your spell save DC.

face. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in
an explosion that fills a 30-oot Emanation originat-
ing from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to in-
stantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoid-
ing the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you
take Force damage equal to 16 times the number
of charges in the staff. Each other creature in the
area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a

cessful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage

Insect Cloud. While holding the staff, you can
take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to cause
a swarm oharmless flying insects to fill a 30-

remain for 10 minutes, making the area Heavily
Obscured for creatures other than you. A strong
wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses
the swarm and ends the effect.

creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you
do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, cancel-
ing its effect and gaining a number of charges equal

brings the staff’s total number of charges above 50,
the staff explodes as if you activated its Retributive
Strike (see below).

Staff of the Python
Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it
lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you,
causing the staff to become a Giant Constrictor
Snake in that space. The snake is under your con-
trol and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn
immediately after yours.
On your turn, you can mentally command the
snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of
you and you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.
You decide what action the snake takes and where it
moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard
a location. Absent commands from you, the snake
defends itself.
As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake
to revert to staff form in its current space, and you
can’t use the staff’s property again for 1 hour. If the
snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts
to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is de-
stroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before
losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.
Staff of the Woodlands

Tree Form. You can take a Magic action to plant

and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into
a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a
5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top
spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears
ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation
magic that can be discerned with the Detect Magic
spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic
action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any
creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to
a staff.
Regaining Charges. The staff regains 1d6 ex-
pended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last
charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its proper-
ties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.
Staff of Thunder and Lightning
Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff
that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage
rolls made with it. It also has the following addi-
tional properties. Once one of these properties is
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Lightning. When you hit with a melee attack
using the staff, you can cause the target to take an
extra 2d6 Lightning damage (no action required).
Thunder. When you hit with a melee attack using
the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of
thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required).
The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Consti-
tution saving throw or have the Stunned condition
until the end of your next turn.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Thunder and Lightning. Immediately after you
hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take
a Bonus Action to use the Lightning and Thunder
properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so
doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties,
only the use of this one.
Lightning Strike. You can take a Magic action to
cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff’s tip
in a Line that is 5 eet wide and 120 eet long. Each
creature in that Line makes a DC 17 Dexterity sav-
ing throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a ailed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Thunderclap. You can take a Magic action to
cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out
to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot Emana-

have or need a head, or if the GM decides that the
creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this

Monsters
Stat Block Overview
A monster has a stat block that contains the rules
necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are di-
vided into the following parts:
Name and General Details. The name of the mon-
ster is followed by its size, creature type (along
with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
Combat Highlights. Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed,
and Initiative are provided here.
Ability Scores. A monster’s ability scores, ability
modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
Other Details. The monster’s Senses, Languages,
and CR entries appear here. Additional details ap-
pear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies,
Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster
lacks those details, entries for them don’t appear.
Traits. Monster characteristics that are active at all
times or during certain situations appear here.
Actions. The monster can take the actions here in
addition to those in “Playing the Game.”
Bonus Actions. This section provides a monster’s
Bonus Actions, if any.
Reactions and Legendary Actions. These sections
provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.
Parts of a Stat Block
The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glos-
sary” and in this section.
Size
A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you
choose the creature’s size from those options. See
“Playing the Game” for information on size.
Creature Type
Each monster has a tag that identifies the type o
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class fea-
tures, and other effects in the game interact in spe-
cial ways with creatures of a particular type.
The game includes the following creature types,
which have no rules of their own:
Aberrations are utterly alien beings, such as abo-
leths and cloakers.
Beasts are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like
horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
Celestials are magical creatures, such as angels and
pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
Constructs are magically created creatures such as
homunculi and shield guardians.
Dragons are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as
red dragons and wyverns.
Elementals are beings from the Elemental Planes,
such as efreet and water elementals.
Fey are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces
of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
Fiends are creatures tied to terrifying Lower
Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
Giants are towering beings with humanlike shapes,
like fire giants and trolls.
Humanoids are people defined by their roles and
professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors.
They include members of varied species.
Monstrosities are unnatural creatures with
strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
Oozes are gelatinous creatures, including black
puddings and gelatinous cubes.
Plants are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters,
such as shambling mounds and treants.
Undead are spirits and the reanimated dead, such
as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.
Descriptive Tags
A monster might have one or more tags in parenthe-
ses following its type. Such tags provide additional
categorization and have no rules of their own, but
certain game effects might refer to them.
Alignment
The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster,
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment,
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider
whether an individual leans toward one of the other
alignments.
“Character Creation” describes the nine align-
ments and unaligned creatures.
Armor Class
A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.
Initiative
The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initia-
tive modifier ollowed by the monster’s Initiative
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity
modifier, but some monsters have additional mod-
ifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that
number.
If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the
Game.”

a class tag after its creature type is considered a
member of that class for Attunement purposes.
Senses
The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive
Perception score, as well as any special senses the
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special
senses are described in “Rules Glossary.”
Languages
This entry lists languages that the monster can use
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can under-
stand a language but can’t communicate with it,
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.
Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary” for
more information.
Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,”
while guidance on using CR to plan potential com-
bat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.”
Experience Points
The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster
is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Ex-
perience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is
awarded for defeating the monster in combat or
otherwise neutralizing it.
Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster sum-
moned by a spell or another magical ability is worth
the XP noted in its stat block.

Traits
A monster’s traits, if any, are features that are ac-
tive at all times or in certain situations.
Actions
A monster can take the actions in this section or
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as
described in “Playing the Game.”
Attack Notation
The entry or a monster’s attack identifies whether
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range,
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game”
and “Spells.”
Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described
after the “Hit:” notation.
Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a
miss, that information follows the “Miss:” notation.
Hit or Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs
regardless of whether it hits or misses its target,
that information follows the “Hit or Miss:” notation.
Saving Throw Effect Notation
If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identi-
fies the kind osave required and then provides the
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a
failed or successful save.
“Half damage only” on a successful save means
the target takes half as much damage (round down)
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all
other parts of the effect.

257
System Reference Document 5.2.1
Damage Notation
A stat block usually provides both a number and a
die expression for each instance of damage. For ex-
ample, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.
Multiattack
Some creatures can make more than one attack
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a
creature can make, as well as any additional abili-
ties it can use, as part of the Attack action.
Spellcasting
If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
A monster’s spell can have special rules or restric-
tions. For example, a green hag can cast the Invisi-
bility spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction,
which means the spell affects only the hag.
Spell Components. The Spellcasting trait notes
whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the
need for certain spell components. If any spell com-
ponents are required, describe the monster’s use of
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that
requires Material components has them.
Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a cast-
ing time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell-
casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in
just one action unless the action’s description states
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”
Bonus Action
If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for de-
tails on Bonus Actions.
Reactions
If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed
in this section along with their triggers. See “Play-
ing the Game” for details on Reactions.
Legendary Actions
If the monster has Legendary Action options, those
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an
action that a monster can take immediately after
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions
can be taken at a time and only after another crea-
ture’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legend-
ary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is
otherwise unable to take actions.
The monster has a limited number of Legendary
Action uses, and that number is specified in the
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all ex-
pended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Limited Usage
Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used. Here are the
most common ways that usage is limited:
X/Day. This notation means the stat block part can
be used a certain number of times (represented
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be
taken once and that the monster must finish a
Long Rest to take it again.
Recharge X–Y. This notation means a monster
can use the stat block part once. At the start of
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll
is within the number range given in the notation
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use
of that part, which also recharges when the mon-
ster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example,
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that ac-
tion if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This nota-
tion means the monster can use the stat block
part once and must then finish a Short or Long
Rest to use it again.

Traits
Amphibious. The aboleth can breathe air and water.
Eldritch Restoration. If destroyed, the aboleth gains
a new body in 5d10 days, reviving with all its Hit
Points in the Far Realm or another location chosen
by the GM.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair). If
the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to suc-
ceed instead.
Mucus Cloud. While underwater, the aboleth is sur-
rounded by mucus. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 14,
each creature in a 5-foot Emanation originating from
the aboleth at the end of the aboleth’s turn. Failure: The
target is cursed. Until the curse ends, the target’s skin
becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water,
and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater.
While the cursed creature is outside a body of water,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of
every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin
before those minutes have passed.
Probing Telepathy. If a creature the aboleth can see
communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the abo-
leth learns the creature’s greatest desires.
Actions
Multiattack. The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks
and uses either Consume Memories or Dominate Mind
if available.
Tentacle. Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 15 ft. Hit: 12
(2d6 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large
or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (es-
cape DC 14) from one of four tentacles.
Consume Memories. Intelligence Saving Throw: DC 16,
one creature within 30 feet that is Charmed or Grap-
pled by the aboleth. Failure: 10 (3d6) Psychic damage.
Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The aboleth
gains the target’s memories if the target is a Humanoid
and is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this action.
Dominate Mind (2/Day). Wisdom Saving Throw: DC
16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet.
Failure: The target has the Charmed condition until
the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence
from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an
ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within
60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target
can communicate telepathically with each other over
any distance.
The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage
as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile
away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on
a success.
Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after
another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to
take one of the following actions. The aboleth regains all
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Lash. The aboleth makes one Tentacle attack.
Psychic Drain. If the aboleth has at least one creature
Charmed or Grappled, it uses Consume Memories and
regains 5 (1d10) Hit Points.

the grapple ends, the target has the Blinded and Re-
strained conditions, is suffocating, and takes 10 (2d6 +

The rug can smother only one creature at a time.

tion, the rug halves the damage it takes (round down),
and the target takes the same amount of damage.

Traits
Ooze Cube. The cube ﬁlls its entire space and is trans-
parent. Other creatures can enter that space, but a
creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf
and has Disadvantage on the saving throw.
Creatures inside the cube have Total Cover, and the
cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium
or Small creatures inside itself at a time.
As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can
pull a creature or an object out of the cube by suc-
ceeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, and the
puller takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage.
Transparent. Even when the cube is in plain sight, a
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice the cube if the creature hasn’t wit-
nessed the cube move or otherwise act.
Actions
Pseudopod. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 12
(3d6 + 2) Acid damage.
Engulf. The cube moves up to its Speed without
provoking Opportunity Attacks. The cube can move
through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has
room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube
trait). Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 12, each creature
whose space the cube enters for the ﬁrst time during
this move. Failure: 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target
is engulfed. An engulfed target is suffocating, can’t cast
spells with a Verbal component, has the Restrained
condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start
of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves,
the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target
can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC
12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check,
the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied
space. Success: Half damage, and the target moves to
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there
is no unoccupied space, the target fails the save instead.

the body, but the target retains awareness. The ghost
can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,
except ones that speciﬁcally target Undead. The ghost’s
game statistics are the same, except it uses the pos-
sessed target’s Speed, as well as the target’s Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution modiﬁers.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 Hit
Points or the ghost leaves as a Bonus Action. When the
possession ends, the ghost appears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the target, and the target is im-
mune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours.

sion for 24 hours.

lasts until the harpy’s Concentration ends on it. Wisdom
Saving Throw: DC 11, each Humanoid and Giant in a

has the Incapacitated condition and ignores the Luring
Song of other harpies. If the target is more than 5 feet

harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5
feet of the harpy. It doesn’t avoid Opportunity Attacks;
however, before moving into damaging terrain (such
as lava or a pit) and whenever it takes damage from a
source other than the harpy, the target repeats the save.
