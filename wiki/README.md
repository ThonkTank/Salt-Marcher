# Salt Marcher Knowledge Base

## Overview & Audience
Salt Marcher documentation is organised around the daily workflows that game masters, maintainers, and playtest facilitators perform in Obsidian. This hub explains how the guides connect, points to the broader documentation sets, and outlines how to contribute updates without breaking the shared conventions.

## Prerequisites
- Obsidian Desktop 1.5 or later with community plugins enabled.
- Access to the Salt Marcher plugin build and the accompanying vault assets.
- Familiarity with the repository's shared documentation [style guide](../style-guide.md) as summarised in the root README.

## Step-by-step Workflow
1. Start with [Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md) to install, enable, and verify the plugin inside an Obsidian vault.
2. Use the feature guides—[Cartographer](./Cartographer.md), [Library](./Library.md), [Encounter](./Encounter.md), and [Data Management](./Data-Management.md)—to perform daily prep, travel, and upkeep tasks.
3. Cross-reference the plugin and root documentation hubs for architectural details or contribution requirements before submitting changes.
