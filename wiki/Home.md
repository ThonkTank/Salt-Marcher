# Salt Marcher Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Salt Marcher wiki. It complements the [project README](../README.md) with practitioner-focused guides for campaign cartography, travel support, and vault data stewardship.

## Audience & Purpose
- **Game masters using Obsidian** who need a reliable reference while preparing or running hex-crawl campaigns.
- **Contributors and maintainers** who extend the plugin and require a concise description of runtime behaviour and expectations.
- **Playtest facilitators** who must communicate current capabilities and gaps to stakeholders.

Each article documents the current implementation state. If you spot a mismatch between documentation and behaviour, please update the relevant page and leave a note in `Critique.txt`.

## Navigation
