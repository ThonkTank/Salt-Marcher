## üö® Active TODOs (By Priority)

### CRITICAL (Feature komplett kaputt/unbrauchbar)
None currently! All blocking issues resolved. ‚úÖ

### HIGH (Feature fehlt oder stark beeintr√§chtigt)
2. **[HIGH] Almanac Full Implementation Missing** - MVP + Month View + Vault Integration + Event Editor functional, additional features needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - ‚úÖ Phase 12.1-12.4 MVP Complete - basic time display, upcoming events, advance controls, month grid view with event indicators, view switching
   - ‚úÖ Phase 13 Priority 1 Complete - vault data integration (loads calendar from vault, persists time advances)
   - ‚úÖ Phase 13 Priority 2 Complete - event editor (full form, validation, single/recurring events, 18 tests)
   - Still missing (Phase 13 Priority 3-7):
     - Week/timeline calendar grid views with event visualization
     - Month navigation controls (prev/next month buttons)
     - Astronomical cycles UI (moon phases, eclipses, etc.)
     - Event inbox with priority sorting
     - Search functionality implementation
   - Current: Full event CRUD in UI, vault persistence working, event editor functional with all recurrence patterns
   - Location: src/workmodes/almanac/view/ (event-editor-modal.ts: 562 lines, fully implemented)
   - See: [docs/almanac-system.md](docs/almanac-system.md) for detailed status

### MEDIUM (Feature unvollst√§ndig aber teilweise nutzbar)
4. **[MEDIUM] POI Integration Missing** - Cannot place location markers on map
   - Goal: "Ortsmarker (St√§dte, Landmarken)" in Cartographer
   - Phase 9 Location system fully implemented but no UI access
   - Need: Cartographer mode for placing/editing location markers
   - Location: Cartographer brush/inspector modes

5. **[MEDIUM] Cartographer Brush Error** - Brush mode logs error messages
   - Terrain-brush functionality potentially broken, needs real testing
   - Location: Cartographer terrain-brush mode

6. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Almanac - No Keyboard Shortcuts** - All interactions require mouse
   - No keyboard shortcuts for common actions (advance time, navigate events)
   - Arrow keys don't navigate event list, Space/Enter don't activate
   - Location: src/workmodes/almanac/view/ (all components)

7. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Weather History/Forecast - Collapsed by Default** - Users might miss these features
   - History and forecast sections hidden on load (line 132-133)
   - No visual cue that content is collapsible (no ‚ñ∂ icon on headers)
   - Users need to discover collapse functionality by trial
   - Location: src/workmodes/session-runner/travel/ui/weather-panel.ts:132-133

8. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Building Management - Unclear Capacity Warnings** - Capacity limits not visible until error
   - User only sees "max capacity" Notice after clicking Assign
   - Need: Show visual capacity indicator (e.g., "Workers: 3/5") prominently in worker section
   - Location: building-management-modal.ts:489-491

9. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Building Status - Unclear Condition Impact** - User doesn't understand what condition affects
   - Shows "Condition: 75%" without explaining gameplay impact
   - Need: Add helper text like "Condition affects production rate and durability"
   - Location: building-management-modal.ts:195-212

10. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Production Dashboard - No Units Displayed** - Production shows percentages without context
    - Shows "75%" but unclear what this percentage represents
    - Need: Show actual values (e.g., "7.5 Gold/day at 75% efficiency")
    - Location: production-visualization.ts

11. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Weather Details - Categorical Values Lack Precision** - Some values show categories instead of numbers
    - Precipitation: "M√§√üiger Niederschlag" (what mm/h?), Visibility: "Gut" (how many meters?)
    - Players wanting precise values for calculations can't get them
    - Need: Show both category and exact value: "M√§√üiger Niederschlag (5 mm/h)" or add tooltip
    - Location: weather-icons.ts:117-133

12. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Weather Icon - No Severity Indication** - Icon shows type but not severity
    - "Regen" icon looks same for light drizzle and torrential downpour
    - Only text label shows severity, less scannable UI
    - Need: Visual severity indicator (icon size, color, badge, or animation)
    - Location: weather-panel.ts:118-124

13. **[MEDIUM] [UX] Weather Update Timing Not Visible** - Users don't know when weather will change
    - No indication of how long current weather lasts
    - No "next update in X hours" display
    - Critical for multi-day travel planning
    - Need: Show weather duration/next change time
    - Location: weather-panel.ts (entire component)

### LOW (Nice-to-have, Verbesserungen)
14. **[LOW] [UX] Almanac Events List - No Filtering/Sorting** - All events shown without organization
