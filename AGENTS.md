# AGENTS.md

This file defines the repository-specific operating constraints for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) and OpenAI Codex agents. Treat it as local engineering law: preserve the documented architecture, prefer repository-specific precedent over generic agent habits, and do not weaken an invariant unless the user explicitly asks for that change.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

**Language:** Java (no modules), JavaFX UI, SQLite via raw JDBC. Build via Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) with Java 21 toolchain and OpenJFX plugin.

**Structure** (feature-first):
- `src/features/<feature>/{model,repository,service,ui}` — primary architecture by domain capability
- `src/database/DatabaseManager` — connection factory. `getConnection()` returns a fresh Connection with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` and `journal_mode=WAL`; callers own it via try-with-resources. `setupDatabase()` uses idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `INSERT OR IGNORE` seeding
- `src/importer/` and `src/shared/crawler/` — crawler/import pipeline
- `src/ui/` — JavaFX shell/bootstrap (`src/ui/bootstrap/`) plus shared UI-only components (`src/ui/components/`)
- `resources/salt-marcher.css` — single CSS source of truth. `data/` for runtime data and backups

**AGENTS.md placement convention:** the root `AGENTS.md` is for project-wide rules only. Feature-specific architecture, workflows, invariants, package roles, and editor/runtime behavior belong in the nearest local `AGENTS.md` under that feature subtree. If a rule stops being globally true and starts describing one feature, move it out of the root file. When both files exist, apply both, with the deeper local file governing the feature-specific details. Before changing files in a subtree, check whether that subtree defines a nearer `AGENTS.md`; if it does, treat that local file as required context, not optional reference.

**DB storage conventions:** Multi-value fields stored as delimited strings — `KEY:value,KEY:value,...` (e.g. `SavingThrows = "CON:10,INT:12"`, `Senses = "darkvision:60"`). Junction tables (`creature_biomes`, `creature_subtypes`, `item_tags`) for many-to-many. `campaign_state` is a singleton row (id=1). No name-column indexes anywhere (leading-wildcard `LIKE` can't use B-tree).

## Build & Run

```bash
./gradlew build                  # compile + convention checks
./gradlew build --console=plain 2>&1  # recompile after every code change — fix all errors before proceeding
./gradlew run                    # start JavaFX app
./gradlew installDesktopApp      # reinstall desktop launcher
./gradlew crawler                # monster crawl + import
./gradlew crawlerItemsPipeline   # item crawl + import
./gradlew crawlerItemsSlugs      # slug-list only
./gradlew importMonsters         # import only (no crawl)
./gradlew importItems            # import only (no crawl)
```

Legacy end-to-end scripts: `./scripts/crawl.sh`, `./scripts/crawl-items.sh`.

No test framework. No linter. The app database is SQLite at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/salt-marcher/game.db` (auto-created on first run). Schema changes require deleting that DB and re-running `./scripts/crawl.sh` — there are no ALTER TABLE migrations. For ad-hoc DB inspection, prefer the vendored CLI at `./tools/sqlite3` or `./gradlew sqliteQuery --args='data/game.db .tables'`.

**After code changes, do not stop at `./gradlew build` alone** when the desktop app is the manual test surface. Default to running `./gradlew build` and then `./gradlew installDesktopApp` before handoff unless the user explicitly says not to reinstall the desktop app. Notes about "nicht geprüfte Vorgänge" (unchecked operations) are expected and can be ignored.

**First run:** database is empty after clone. Run `./scripts/crawl.sh` to populate monster data (requires `crawler.properties` — copy from `crawler.properties.example` and add a valid D&D Beyond session cookie). `./scripts/crawl-items.sh` does the same for items. Without data the app starts but shows no creatures.

## UI Shell Architecture — Cockpit Layout

The shell uses a four-panel "cockpit" layout. Views project content into fixed panels:

```
+---toolbar------------------------------+
| side | Controls      | Details         |
| bar  | (top-left)    | (top-right)     |
|      |---------------+-----------------|
|      | Main          | State           |
|      | (bottom-left) | (bottom-right)  |
+------+---------------+-----------------+
```

- **Controls** — filters, sliders, tool palettes (`getControlsContent()`)
- **Main** — primary workspace: monster table, hex map, canvas (`getMainContent()`)
- **Details** — detail inspector: stat blocks, tile properties (`getDetailsContent()`)
- **State** — game state: encounter roster/tracker, travel info (`getStateContent()`)

Left column is a VBox (Controls takes natural height, Main fills rest — not resizable). Right column is a vertical SplitPane (Details / State — resizable). SplitPane items are set once and never mutated; content is swapped inside StackPane containers to preserve divider positions.

- **AppShell** — `BorderPane`: sidebar (left) | `mainSplit` (center, horizontal SplitPane: `leftColumn` | `rightSplit`). Divider positions saved per-ViewId and restored on navigate-back
- **AppView** interface: `getMainContent()`, `getControlsContent()`, `getDetailsContent()`, `getStateContent()`, `getTitle()`, `getToolbarItems()`, `getIconText()`, `onShow()`/`onHide()`. Only `getMainContent()` and `getTitle()` are required; all others have defaults
- **ViewId** enum + **ViewCategory** (SESSION vs EDITOR). To add a new view: (1) add enum entry, (2) implement AppView, (3) call `shell.registerView()` in SaltMarcherApp
- **AppShell navigation:** `navigateTo()` saves dividers → `onHide()` → `applyViewContent()` → restores dividers → `onShow()`. `refreshPanels()` re-reads all 4 panels without touching SplitPane items (safe for mode switches). `refreshToolbar()` rebuilds toolbar only
- **SESSION views** return `null` from `getDetailsContent()`/`getStateContent()` → shell shows its own **InspectorPane** and **ScenePane**, persistent across SESSION view switches. **EDITOR views** override these to provide view-specific content
- **InspectorPane** (shell-owned Details default): `showStatBlock(id)` toggles; `ensureStatBlock(id)` always shows; `showContent(title, node)` for arbitrary content; cancels pending async loads on new requests
- **ScenePane**/**SceneHandle** (shell-owned State default) — tabbed bottom-right area. Views register persistent tabs via `SceneHandle`. Tab bar auto-hidden when only 1 tab. `SceneHandle.setContent(node)` swaps content

### Feature-Local AGENTS Files

- `src/features/encounter/AGENTS.md` — encounter-specific interaction, generation, and combat/runtime behavior
- `src/features/world/hexmap/AGENTS.md` — hex map and overworld-specific rendering, editing, and calendar rules
- `src/features/world/dungeonmap/AGENTS.md` — dungeon editor architecture, model layering, and package roles

## Key Conventions

The rules in this section are decision filters, not soft preferences. When multiple approaches are possible, choose the one that preserves ownership, minimizes hidden coupling, and matches the existing repository pattern. If a proposed change requires an exception, name the exception explicitly instead of silently drifting the pattern.

### Authoritative Model Ownership
- Model the domain as self-owning objects composed bottom-up from simpler primitives into higher-complexity objects
- Define each capability exactly once at the lowest common owner that is actually edited, described, or constrained by that capability
- Higher-level objects may compose and reuse lower-level capabilities, but must not mirror, duplicate, cache, or locally re-derive the same capability state
- The object being acted on is the authoritative owner of its capabilities; other systems must query that object for the central truth instead of maintaining parallel interpretations
- When choosing where behavior or state belongs, prefer the stable single owner over convenience adapters, projections, synchronization code, or cross-system shadow state

### Code Style
- 4-space indentation, `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for methods and locals, lowercase packages
- `try-with-resources` for all JDBC connections, statements, result sets
- UI text stays German; established DnD terms (`Encounter`, `CR`, `Deadly`) remain English. Code identifiers, comments, and commit messages are English
- Avoid `System.out` and `System.err` in feature service/repository code. Error logging elsewhere: `System.err.println` with format `ClassName.methodName(): message` (no logging framework)
- Comments must earn their keep. Use them to preserve invariants, UX rules, or non-obvious constraints; do not narrate obvious control flow or restate the code in English

### Repository & Service Conventions
- Repositories are stateless (`Connection` passed in). Let repositories propagate `SQLException`; fallback behavior, retries, and user-facing degradation belong in services
- Utility services (`*Calculator`, `*Scoring`, `*Tuning`, `*Setup`, `*Classifier`, `*Generator`) are static-only with private constructor
- Stateful workflow/session services (`*ApplicationService`, `*Session`) are instance-based
- `service/generation/internal` contains search collaborators; keep internals package-private where possible
- Within `service/` packages, keep public services at the package root. When a concern grows into a subsystem with multiple collaborators, place the coordinator and helpers together in a focused subpackage (e.g. `service.topology`). Same rule for editor/UI subpackages — move close helpers with the subpackage and keep internals non-public instead of widening visibility to cross package boundaries
- Cross-feature read DTOs belong in `src/features/<feature>/api/`, not in `model/`. Use the `*Summary` naming pattern for lightweight selector DTOs. Keep `model/` focused on domain/editor state, not transport shapes for other features
- Feature module APIs should expose narrow, role-specific setup methods. Do not hide unrelated wiring behind a generic `initialize(...)` entrypoint

### Async & Threading
- `javafx.concurrent.Task` + `new Thread()` (daemon, named `sm-<operation>` e.g. `sm-filter-load`, `sm-encounter-gen`, `sm-combat-setup`, `sm-stat-block`, `sm-save-terrain`)
- Always set `setOnFailed` handler; guard cancellation via `if (!task.isCancelled())`. Background work without explicit failure handling is incomplete, not "good enough"
- **Callbacks:** `Consumer`/`Runnable` pattern; pane setters follow `setOn<Event>()` naming

### CSS & Theming
- `resources/salt-marcher.css` is the single source of truth for design tokens (CSS variables on `.root`)
- `ThemeColors.java` has `Color` constants mirroring CSS variables for Canvas-only drawing — must be kept in sync manually

### UI Naming
- `*View` = AppView impls, `*Pane` = Region subclasses, `*Dropdown` = anchored non-modal editor windows backed by `Popup`, `*Popup` = legacy popup controllers not yet renamed, `*Controls` = left-column control panels, `*Canvas` = canvas subclasses for specific contexts

### Editor & Inspector Design Rules

**Editor windows:** must be anchored dropdown windows, not modal pop-up dialogs. Use non-modal `Popup`-based dropdowns that stay within fullscreen mode, return focus to the trigger, and render confirmations inline. Do not introduce modal flows for editor CRUD just because they are faster to wire.

**Inspector (upper-right Details):** the single global, context-spanning information surface. Static or read-mostly content (stat blocks, item descriptions, room/area descriptions, table summaries) must be shown via the shared `DetailsNavigator`/`InspectorPane` flow so back/forward history works consistently. Do not introduce feature-local "details" panels that duplicate this role; that is architectural drift, not harmless local convenience. Treat the inspector as persistent global navigation state — do not clear or replace it just because a view temporarily has no selection. Selection state and inspector state are separate concerns: only update the inspector if the same card is still the currently visible global entry.

**State pane (lower-right):** view-local forms, tool settings, create/rename/delete actions, validation feedback, transient workflow hints, and interactive workflow UI belong here.

**Narrow inspector exceptions:** small, direct GM quick interactions on the currently open reference object (short name/notes/description edits) are allowed. Keep these lightweight, single-entity scoped, and subordinate to the inspector's primary role as a read-first reference surface.

**Editor controls:** must be self-explanatory without helper prose. No explanatory copy, onboarding text, repeated summaries, or filler narration. Prefer short labels, stable grouping, and consistent ordering. In sidebars: active context first, tool-specific settings second, management actions after selectors, visibility toggles last. Render control text from enum label/value accessors instead of duplicating German strings in multiple panes.

## Testing & Verification

Do not add or change automated tests unless explicitly requested. The minimum quality gate is `./gradlew build`. If you change importer or parser flows, run the relevant crawler/import task. If you change schema or storage assumptions, rebuild `game.db` from crawled data and protect user-created data with backups or migration logic.

Verification claims must be literal. Do not imply that a build, install, import, migration, or manual check happened unless you actually ran it. If something was not verified, say so directly and name the missing check.

After each completed implementation pass, rerun `./gradlew build` and then `./gradlew installDesktopApp` before handoff. Skip the reinstall only when the user explicitly waives it or when the task is purely non-code planning/review work.

## Commit Guidelines

Follow Conventional Commits: `feat: add encounter recovery filter`, `refactor(ui): simplify shell navigation`. Keep each commit focused on one concern. Call out schema, crawler, or backup-format impacts explicitly. Do not hide unrelated cleanup inside a convenience commit.

Start-of-task protocol for every implementation request:
1. Inspect the worktree for pre-existing local modifications.
2. Commit those existing modifications.
3. Push them to `main`.
4. Only then begin the newly requested change.

This is mandatory, not advisory. Do not start implementing a fresh task on top of uncommitted or unpushed carry-over changes. If you cannot safely complete that protocol, stop and surface the blocker explicitly instead of silently continuing on a dirty base.

## Security

Never commit secrets. Keep crawler cookies only in local `crawler.properties` (copy from `crawler.properties.example`). Store database backups in `data/backups/db/`, not in the repository root.
