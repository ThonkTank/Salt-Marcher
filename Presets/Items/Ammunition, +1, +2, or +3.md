# Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3
*Weapon (Any Ammunition) Uncommon*

You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

This ammunition is typically found or sold in quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of the same rarity.
