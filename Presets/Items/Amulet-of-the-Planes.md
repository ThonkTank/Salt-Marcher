# Amulet of the Planes
*Wondrous (Requires Attunement) Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you can take a Magic action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you cast *Plane Shift*. On a failed check, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination determined by rolling 1d100 and consulting the following table.
