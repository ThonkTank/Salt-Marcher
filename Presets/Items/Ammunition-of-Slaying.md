# Ammunition of Slaying
*Weapon (Any Ammunition) Very Rare*

This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.
