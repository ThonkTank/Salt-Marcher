# Dragon Orb
*Wondrous (Requires Attunement) Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

## Charges

This item has 7 charges.
regains 1d4 + 3 charges at Dawn.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts *Suggestion* on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.
