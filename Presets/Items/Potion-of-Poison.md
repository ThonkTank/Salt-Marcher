# Potion of Poison
*Potion Uncommon*

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a *Potion of Healing* or another beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. *Identify* reveals its true nature.

If you drink this potion, you take 4d6 Poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour.
