# Cape of the Mountebank
*Wondrous Rare*

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast *Dimension Door* as a Magic action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is Lightly Obscured by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
