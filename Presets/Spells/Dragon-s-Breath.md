- Casting Time: Bonus Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a hot pepper)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

- Save: DEX (Half damage on success)

You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a Magic action to exhale a 15-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
