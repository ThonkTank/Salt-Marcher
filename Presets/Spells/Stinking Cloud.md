# Stinking Cloud
Level 3 Conjuration

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a rotten egg)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: CON

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is Heavily Obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by *Gust of Wind*) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature can't take an action or a Bonus Action.
