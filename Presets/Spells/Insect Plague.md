# Insect Plague
Level 5 Conjuration

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 300 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a locust)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 4d10 Piercing

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain.

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
