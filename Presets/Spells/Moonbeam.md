# Moonbeam
Level 2 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Druid
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 2d10 Radiant

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the *Polymorph* spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
