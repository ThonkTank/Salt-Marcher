# Cloudkill
Level 5 Conjuration

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by *Gust of Wind*) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is Heavily Obscured.

Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.
