# Fire Shield
Level 4 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Classes: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- Damage: 2d8 Fire

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you Resistance to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 Fire damage from a warm shield or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield.
