# Spike Growth
Level 2 Transmutation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 150 feet
- Components: V, S, M (seven thorns)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Druid, Ranger
- Damage: 2d4 Piercing

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
