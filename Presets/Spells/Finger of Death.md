# Finger of Death
Level 7 Necromancy

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 7d8 + 30 Necrotic

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a **Zombie** (see "Monsters") that follows your verbal orders.
