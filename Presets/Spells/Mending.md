# Mending
Cantrip Transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)
- Duration: Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.
