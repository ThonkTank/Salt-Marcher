# Sunbeam
Level 6 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 6d8 Radiant

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to create a new Line of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
