# Disintegrate
Level 6 Transmutation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: DEX
- Damage: 10d6 + 40 Force

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *Wall of Force.*

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a *True Resurrection* or a *Wish* spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.
