# Weird
Level 9 Illusion

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Concentration: yes
- Classes: Warlock, Wizard
- Save: WIS (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 10d10 Psychic

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.
