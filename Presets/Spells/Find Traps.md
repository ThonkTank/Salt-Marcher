# Find Traps
Level 2 Divination

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Ranger

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the *Alarm* or *Glyph of Warding* spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
