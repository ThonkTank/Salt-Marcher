# Chromatic Orb
Level 1 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 50+ GP)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard
- Attack: ranged spell attack

You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 damage of the chosen type.

If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.
