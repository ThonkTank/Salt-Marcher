# Vitriolic Sphere
Level 4 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 150 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a drop of bile)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: DEX (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 10d4 Acid

You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 Acid damage and another 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only.
