# Thunderwavea
Level 1 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 2d8 Thunder

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.
