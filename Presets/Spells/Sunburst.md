# Sunburst
Level 8 Evocation

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 150 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a piece of sunstone)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 12d6 Radiant

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

A creature Blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell dispels Darkness in its area that was created by any spell.
