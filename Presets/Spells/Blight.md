# Blight
Level 4 Necromancy

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- Save: CON (Half damage on success)
- Damage: 8d8 Necrotic

A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.
