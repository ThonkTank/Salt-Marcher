Level 6 Necromancy

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric

- Damage: 14d6 Necrotic

You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6

Necrotic damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. This spell can't reduce a target's Hit Point maximum below 1.
