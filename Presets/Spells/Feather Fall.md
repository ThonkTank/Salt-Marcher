# Feather Fall
Level 1 Transmutation

- Casting Time: Reaction, which you take when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you falls
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
- Duration: 1 minute
- Classes: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If a creature lands before the spell ends, the creature takes no damage from the fall, and the spell ends for that creature.
