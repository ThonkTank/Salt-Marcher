# Remove Curse
Level 3 Abjuration

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
